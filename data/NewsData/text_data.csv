Starting Tuesday, U.S. carriers will have 15 days to submit applications to the Department of Transportation for routes theyd like to fly between the U.S. and Cuba in whats sure to be a fierce bidding war. The development brings airlines and travelers yet another step closer to scheduled commercial flights between the two countries. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and staff from the State Department flew from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C., to Cuba to formally sign an agreement to resume flights between the two countries. ""You know its usually significant when the President made this announcement of re-establishing diplomatic relations more than a year ago,"" Foxx told CNN. ""It really means a great deal to the people of both countries. Leaving aside the political differences, theres so many cultural connections between the two countries, in some cases family connections, the ability to have educational exchanges and things that happen as a result of resumption of this service, is really, really significant."" The agreement was reached in December. This agreement will mean the potential for 110 daily round-trip flights in and out of Cuba. That includes 20 daily flights to Havana and 10 daily flights to other airports on the island. The airline bidding process will likely last until the middle of March. A U.S. official with direct knowledge of the agreement told CNN that the Department of Transportation could award routes and slots to specific carriers as soon as this summer. Flights between the two countries could resume soon after, but the official says most likely by October. The Department of Transportation is expecting a large number of airline and cargo carriers to apply for rights to fly to the island thats been off-limits for more than 50 years. The signing of the final agreement also means U.S. carriers can now begin the process of bidding on slots at Cuban airports, including Havana and bidding for rights over specific routes. The arrangement does not change charter services, which can still operate. CNN is told there are no plans in the near future for Cuban-owned planes to land in the U.S. under this agreement. Although President Barack Obama has relaxed several of the prohibitions on trade and travel that have existed between the two countries, many remain in place and can only be removed by legislation. The new arrangement will facilitate visits for travelers that fall under one of 12 categories: Visiting family; Humanitarian projects or to provide support to the Cuban people; Official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments and certain intergovernmental organizations; journalistic activities; professional research; educational activities by persons at academic institutions; people-to-people travel; religious activities; public performance, clinics, workshops, athletic or other competitions and exhibitions; authorization to provide travel services, carrier services and remittance-forwarding services; activities of private foundations, research or educational institutes; and exportation of certain Internet-based services.",

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Washington CNN -- President Barack Obama will become the first sitting U.S. President to visit Cuba in 88 years, when he visits Havana in March, White House press secretary Josh Earnest announced Thursday. The visit, which is scheduled for March 21-22, is another big step by the administration in ongoing efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba. The President announced the news via Twitter on Thursday. ""14 months ago, I announced that we would begin normalizing relations with Cuba - and weve already made significant progress,"" he tweeted. ""Our flag flies over our Embassy in Havana once again. More Americans are traveling to Cuba than at any time in the last 50 years."" Our flag flies over our Embassy in Havana once again. More Americans are traveling to Cuba than at any time in the last 50 years. -- President Obama (@POTUS44) February 18, 2016 ""We still have differences with the Cuban government that I will raise directly. America will always stand for human rights around the world,"" he tweeted. ""Next month, Ill travel to Cuba to advance our progress and efforts that can improve the lives of the Cuban people."" We still have differences with the Cuban government that I will raise directly. America will always stand for human rights around the world. -- President Obama (@POTUS44) February 18, 2016 The White House also announced Thursday that the President will meet with Cuban President Raul Castro, as well as entrepreneurs and different members of Cuban society. The President aims to continue to ""chart a new course"" for U.S.- Cuban relations by connecting U.S. and Cuban citizens through travel, commerce and access to information, according to Earnest. The President will be joined by the first lady on his trip to Cuba, after which they will visit Argentina for two days. The last sitting U.S. President to visit Cuba was Calvin Coolidge in 1928. ""President Coolidge traveled to Cuba on a U.S. battleship, so this will be a very different kind of visit,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes wrote in a post on Medium. In the Medium post, Rhodes cited the progress made between the two countries since Obama took office, but also acknowledged there is more to be done especially on human rights and added that the President will continue to raise those issues to Castro. ""As the President has said, Cuba will not change overnight, nor will all of the various differences between our countries go away,"" Rhodes wrote. ""But the guiding principle of our Cuba policy - our North Star - remains taking steps that will improve the lives of the Cuban people."" The trip, long expected, comes after Obamas administration formally reopened ties with Havana in late 2014, following a half-century of enmity. Cuban officials reacted positively to the announcement Thursday. ""U.S. President Barack Obama will be welcomed by the government of Cuba and the Cuban people with our traditional hospitality. It will be an opportunity for (the) President to appreciate the Cuban reality,"" Josefina Vidal, the general director for U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry said at a news conference in Havana Thursday. ""His visit will represent a step forward in relations between Cuba and the US."" At the news conference, Vidal also called for the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba to be lifted and the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo to be returned to Cuban control. The visit was first reported Wednesday by ABC News. Speaking at CNNs GOP town hall on Wednesday night, presidential candidate Marco Rubio slammed the announcement. The Florida senator said that if he were president, he would not visit the island nation - unless it were a ""free Cuba."" The Cuban government is ""an anti-American communist dictatorship,"" said the Cuban-American senator, who has been an outspoken critic of Obamas Cuba policy. ""Theyre a repressive regime."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father emigrated from Cuba, also disparaged the prospect of a presidential visit. ""I think its a real mistake. I think the President ought to be pushing for a free Cuba,"" Cruz said at the same town hall. ""My family has seen firsthand the evil and the oppression in Cuba. We need a president who stands up to our enemies."" The American embassy was reopened and a U.S. flag raised at the compound on Havana harbor in August. Since then, high level U.S. officials have traveled to the island, including Secretary of State John Kerry and transportation chief Anthony Foxx. Travel restrictions have been loosened and economic channels revived. Obama shook Cuban leader Raul Castros hand during an historic face-to-face meeting last spring. That meeting, which transpired during a summit in Panama, was regarded as a breakthrough. But images of the American President stepping onto Cuban soil will provide Obama a lasting illustration of his adage that diplomacy with traditional U.S. foes can yield concrete results. Last week, U.S. air carriers entered a bidding war to secure routes to Cuba after both nations signed an agreement to resume flights between the island and the United States. U.S. travelers, who previously were required to adhere to strict conditions for visits to Cuba, are now able to apply for a broad range of travel licenses, included trips for cultural exchanges and humanitarian work. But travel purely for tourism wont be allowed until the U.S. Congress lifts a longstanding embargo, which also restricts most trade with Cuba. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat who launched a bipartisan Cuba Working Group in December, said Obamas trip would help ""close the book on the outdated Cold War policy that divided us for so many years."" Many lawmakers stand opposed to such a move, arguing the regime in Cuba restricts dissent and tramples on citizens freedom of expression. Leading up to the announcement of Obamas trip, White House officials said Cuba would need to demonstrate human rights reforms before the President would travel there. Rhodes said in a briefing that Obama will meet with dissidents when he visits Cuba in March. He noted Obama met with dissidents at the Summit of the Americas in Panama last year - where he shook Raul Castros hand - and said Obama engages with a ""broad range of actors"" around the world, and that Cuba is no different. He said Obama was not likely to meet with Fidel Castro on the island. Officials say Obama could visit the island to witness a signing of a peace accord between the government of Colombia and the FARC rebel group. Obama committed $400 million to the Colombian government in his most recent budget proposal to implement the deal.",
White House sees Cuba visit as chance to consolidate gains. Critics see caving.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-sees-cuba-visit-as-chance-to-consolidate-gains-critics-see-caving/2016/02/18/a544e12e-d666-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html,02/19/16,www.washingtonpost.com,"In the months since President Obama announced his historic deal to normalize relations with Cuba, the communist government of Raul Castro has taken only the most modest steps toward less authoritarian rule. Nonetheless, the White House announced Thursday that the president will visit Cuba in March in an attempt to bolster the controversial diplomatic deal -- and to spur the sort of political change that the Cuban government has not yet embraced. Speaking to reporters Thursday, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the administrations ""objective here is to do as much as we can with the time we have remaining to make this an irreversible policy."" Obama has made clear that his outreach is focused more on the Cuban people and less on the government. Cuban officials, while eager for American investment, are hoping to reap the economic benefits of a normalization policy while giving up as little political control as possible. The Cuban government continues to crack down on political dissent, and administration officials acknowledge that Havana has not done enough to allow for freedom of expression. Rhodes said Thursday that the president would meet with dissidents during next months visit.

(Ismael Francisco/AP) The independent Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation reported last month that 1,414 Cubans had been detained for political reasons in January, one of the highest monthly figures in recent decades. Of those, the commission reported, 56 peaceful members of the opposition were physically attacked. Nearly all of the arrests occurred during regular Sunday-morning opposition marches to Catholic churches and resulted in brief detentions of four to six hours. The Sunday marches have become a principal avenue of protest for opposition groups. In a December interview with Yahoo News, Obama said he would need to see progress on human rights before planning a trip. ""If, in fact, I with confidence can say that were seeing some progress in the liberty and freedom and possibilities of ordinary Cubans, Id love to use a visit as a way of highlighting that progress,"" he said. ""If were going backwards, then theres not much reason for me to be there."" The president has said repeatedly the way to rebuild the U.S.-Cuba relationship is by people-to-people engagement. First lady Michelle Obama will accompany the president on the visit, which will be March 21 and 22, and the White House is billing it as a chance to engage regular Cubans. Afterward, the Obamas will travel to Argentina for two days, where they will meet with recently elected President Mauricio Macri. ""We want links between Cubans and Americans,"" Rhodes said, ""and the links between our businesses and the engagement between our countries to gain such momentum that theres an inevitability to the opening that is taking place."" Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat who also is a member of the Communist Party, used language similar to Rhodess to describe his governments motivations for hosting Obama. Alzugaray said the visit will ""consolidate the strategy of both governments to bring about a series of fundamental changes,"" making them ""as irreversible as possible."" Cuban President Raul Castro is seen at the Revolution Palace in Havana on Feb. 18, 2016. (Enrique De La Osa/Reuters) The Cuban government has made some efforts to expand communications and opportunities for U.S. businesses on the island in the past year. Havana has opened dozens of WiFi hotspots around the country and forged roaming agreements between the state telecommunications service and U.S. companies Verizon and Sprint. Havana also has authorized direct banking relationships with U.S. financial institutions and lines of U.S. credit for private Cuban businesses on the island, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. A small U.S. tractor manufacturer, Cleber, has received Cuban approval and an unprecedented U.S. Treasury license to establish a manufacturing plant on the island to produce up to 1,000 tractors annually. The decision for Obama to go this early in the year -- even as the Cuban government continues to routinely arrest and detain dissidents -- drew swift and sharp rebukes from some of the top Republicans vying to be their partys presidential nominee as well as from several GOP figures on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), whose father was born in Cuba, tweeted in response to the news: ""My family has seen firsthand the evil and oppression in Cuba. The President should be advocating for a free Cuba!"" In a letter to Obama, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), whose parents were born in Cuba, accused Obama of rewarding the Cuban governments tyranny. ""I urge you to reconsider visiting Cuba and instead insist that the Castro regime finally make some serious concessions that have so far not been prioritized in negotiations,"" Rubio wrote. But administration officials, as well as some independent experts, said the United States would be more likely to achieve meaningful policy agreements by conducting face-to-face talks earlier in the year rather than later. American University government professor William LeoGrande said there are ""about two dozen different conversations underway"" between the two governments, on issues including global health, law enforcement and counternarcotics efforts. ""A trip like this gives impetus to all of those dialogues, so the earlier you do the trip, the more chance you have of reaching agreements on a whole host of additional issues,"" LeoGrande said. And many experts see this as a unique opportunity. Dan Restrepo, who served as Obamas primary adviser on Latin America during the presidents first term, noted that in the past, when Democratic presidents sought a rapprochement, Cuban authorities always derailed the process. When Jimmy Carter tried it, Fidel Castro authorized a mass emigration out of Mariel Harbor in 1980. Bill Clinton had to deal with the shooting down of two Brothers to the Rescue planes by the Cuban air force in 1996, and the 2009 arrest of Alan Gross, a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, froze Obamas initial gestures toward a reset with Cuba. ""Every time you got close to engagement, they backed away,"" Restrepo said. For the government of 84-year-old Raul Castro, who has said he will step down in 2018, the trip comes at a delicate time. He or his brother Fidel, 89, have ruled the island since the 1959 overthrow of U.S.-backed strongman Fulgencio Batista, and whoever succeeds them in power will have little chance of commanding their type of unchallenged authority. Cubas economy is under new strains from the financial turmoil in Venezuela, the islands biggest benefactor. Cubans are leaving the island at the highest levels in decades. The benefits of Raul Castros cautious economic liberalization have been unevenly distributed and disappointing to many. Obama may arrive with what could appear to Cubans to be an extended hand and a clear path for them out of their worst problems. ""I think this is very difficult trip for Cuban government,"" said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former analyst for Cuban intelligence services and now a lecturer at the University of Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. ""The type of trip Obama is planning presents a political challenge. Whatever positive things Raul Castro has said about Obama, he is still seen in the official narrative as the head of the American Empire. Yet he is just as popular on the island as any politician in the world, let alone in Cuba."" If Obamas message is that Cuban nationalism can coexist with the islands ""return to the international liberal world order,"" Lopez-Levy said, it ""presents an acrobatic challenge to a government that has based its legitimacy on what happened in 1959 and the logic of a nationalist revolt."" Obamas trip could have the effect of further raising Cubans expectations for better living standards and more freedoms, Lopez-Levy said, and will almost certainly boost the case of reformers within the Communist Party who want a faster pace of change. Obama on Thursday seemed excited about the visit. ""Itll be fun when we go,"" he said. Miroff reported from Medellin, Colombia. Karen DeYoung contributed to this report.",
Obama's Cuba trip guarantees another Castro crackdown,https://nypost.com/2016/02/18/obamas-cuba-trip-guarantees-another-castro-crackdown/,02/19/16,nypost.com,"President Obama says hes headed to Cuba next month to ""advance our progress"" and increase ""efforts that can improve the lives of the Cuban people."" Lets hope that ""advance"" is worth the brutal crackdown his visit guarantees. In advance of Secretary of State John Kerrys visit last August, the Castros arrested 90 dissidents wearing Obama masks, for protesting in Havana against the reopening of the US embassy. ""What is happening is [Obamas] fault,"" former political prisoner Angel Moya said before the protest. ""The Cuban government has grown bolder. Thats why we have this mask on. Because its his fault."" And what ""progress"" does Obama mean to ""advance""? Yes, Havana released 53 political prisoners in the runup to Obamas normalization of relations -- but it has since rearrested them all. ""We still have differences with the Cuban government that I will raise directly,"" Obama tweeted of his trip. ""America will always stand for human rights around the world."" But not stand up for them, if it endangers a chance to ""make history"" as the first sitting president to visit Cuba in 88 years. Last year, Cuba saw more than 8,616 documented political arrests. November alone brought at least 1,447, the highest monthly total in decades, The World Post reports. Obama & Co. insist the presidents trip will be fruitful, and that he will be meeting with dissidents. Ones the Castros opt to leave free, anyway.",
Dissidents hope for public recognition from Obama on Cuba visit,http://www.firstpost.com/world/dissidents-hope-for-public-recognition-from-obama-on-cuba-visit-reuters-2632954.html,02/19/16,www.firstpost.com,"HAVANA Ostracized by the government and mistrusted by much of the public, Cuba's dissidents are hoping to receive a clear message of support from U.S. President Barack Obama when he visits the island next month. Obama plans to meet dissidents during his March 21-22 visit, the first by a sitting U.S HAVANA Ostracized by the government and mistrusted by much of the public, Cuba's dissidents are hoping to receive a clear message of support from U.S. President Barack Obama when he visits the island next month. Obama plans to meet dissidents during his March 21-22 visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. It follows the rapprochement of December 2014, when Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro ended more than five decades of Cold War-era animosity. Cuba's Communist government has long considered the dissidents a tiny and illegitimate minority funded by U.S. interests, while anti-Castro groups hold them up as champions of democracy. Political opponents say a public blessing from Obama might improve their standing and the cause of human rights in Cuba. ""It's possible the visit will help raise the hopes of the Cuban people, which is important because Cuba is short on many things, most of all hope,"" said Elizardo Sanchez, leader of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, which monitors arrests of political opponents. Sanchez said Cuba is holding about 90 political prisoners, including some convicted hijackers and spies and 11 former prisoners out on parole. Cuba says it has no political prisoners. In addition Cuban officials briefly detain an average of more than 700 dissidents a month, the commission says. Obama's Republican critics have called the visit a capitulation, while Cuban dissidents are mostly supportive. ""Any gesture of solidarity, any words or gestures, any contact with the peaceful opposition would be well received by the majority of the population,"" said Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, which says it has about 3,000 members, making it the largest opposition group in Cuba. Cuban Foreign Ministry official Josefina Vidal said Cuba hoped Obama would meet with ""the real Cuban civil society,"" a term making a distinction between most Cubans and anti-government activists. Some Cuban dissidents prefer the previous U.S. policy of isolating Cuba and say Obama has failed them. The Ladies in White, who march each Sunday in Havana, say Obama is unwelcome unless he responds to their request that he denounce the repression of activists and calls for amnesty for political prisoners. ""If he makes a strong statement repudiating these human rights violations, then we will consider it an advance in human rights,"" said Berta Soler, leader of the group. ""In practice, we have not seen a thing."" (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Tom Brown) This story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.",
Obama cheered in Havana at start of historic visit to Cuba,http://www.firstpost.com/fwire/obama-cheered-in-havana-at-start-of-historic-visit-to-cuba-reuters-2689374.html,03/08/16,www.firstpost.com,"HAVANA President Barack Obama arrived to small but cheering crowds on Sunday at the start of a historic visit to Cuba that opened a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government after decades of hostility between the former Cold War foes. The three-day trip, the first by a U.S HAVANA President Barack Obama arrived to small but cheering crowds on Sunday at the start of a historic visit to Cuba that opened a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government after decades of hostility between the former Cold War foes. The three-day trip, the first by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years, is the culmination of a diplomatic opening announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, ending an estrangement that began when the Cuban revolution ousted a pro-American government in 1959. ""It's a historic opportunity to engage directly with the Cuban people,"" Obama told staff at the newly reopened U.S. Embassy who were gathered at a hotel, his first stop after arriving in the afternoon. Groups of Cubans watched the motorcade from balconies and backyards as Obama was driven downtown, where a small crowd of Cubans braved a tropical downpour and tight security. They chanted: ""Viva Obama, Viva Fidel,"" as the president and his family left after eating dinner in a rundown neighborhood. Obama, who abandoned a longtime U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba, wants to make his policy shift irreversible even if a Republican wins the White House in the Nov. 8 election. But major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, and the Democratic president's critics say the visit is premature. U.S. officials concede the trip may not yield immediate concessions from Cuba on rights and economic freedom. On Sunday, one bystander shouted: ""Down with the blockade,"" in reference to the U.S. embargo in place for 54 years that remains the top irritant for Cubans. Obama, who responded to the shout by raising his right hand, has asked Congress to rescind the embargo but has been blocked by the Republican leadership. Underscoring the ideological divide that persists between Washington and Havana, Cuban police, backed by hundreds of pro-government demonstrators, broke up the regular march of a leading dissident group, the Ladies in White, detaining about 50 people just hours before Obama arrived. AIR FORCE ONE IN CUBA Obama arrived at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport in Air Force One, the presidential jet with ""United States of America"" emblazoned across its fuselage, a sight almost unimaginable not long ago on the island, just 90 miles (145 km) off the coast of Florida. He was met by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, the top Cuban official present. The formal welcoming ceremony will be on Monday when Obama meets the Cuban president at the presidential palace. U.S. officials appeared unfazed by Castros absence from the airport welcome, even though he personally met and greeted Pope Francis in September. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted that Obamas visit was a ""big deal"" but that he got ""no respect."" Obama will hold talks with Castro - but not his brother Fidel, the revolutionary leader - and speak to entrepreneurs on Monday. He meets privately with dissidents, addresses Cubans live on state-run media and attends an exhibition baseball game on Tuesday. The trip carries both symbolism and substance after decades of hostility between Washington and Havana. Traveling with first lady Michelle Obama, her mother and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, Obama took in the sights of the colonial-era neighborhood and was given a tour of Havana's 18th century cathedral by Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a role in secret talks that led to the rapprochement 15 months ago. The Obamas dined at the San Cristobal restaurant, run by an Afro-Cuban as part of a cautious opening to private enterprise since Fidel Castro handed power to his brother in 2008. The trip makes Obama the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge arrived on a battleship in 1928 and may help chip away at barriers to U.S.-Cuba trade and travel. Since rapprochement, the two sides have restored diplomatic ties and signed commercial deals on telecommunications and scheduled airline service. Obama has used executive authority to loosen trade and travel restrictions to advance his outreach to Cuba, one of his top foreign policy priorities along with the Iran nuclear deal. Cuba still complains about U.S. control of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay under a 1934 lease agreement that Havana says is no longer valid and that Obama has said is not up for discussion. Havana is unhappy with U.S. support for dissidents and anti-communist radio and TV programs beamed into Cuba. Speaking to reporters, Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment minister Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz said before the U.S. president's arrival that Obama's regulatory moves ""go in the right direction."" But he added: ""We cant reach a normalization of relations with the blockade still in effect."" '?QUE BOLA CUBA?' The Americans in turn criticize one-party rule and repression of political opponents, an issue that aides said Obama would address publicly and privately. Obama's critics at home accuse him of making too many concessions for too little in return from the Cuban government and of using his trip to take an unearned ""victory lap."" Obamas first words to the Cuban people came in a message on Twitter, a social media service that few Cubans can use regularly because of government restrictions on Internet access. ""?Que bola Cuba?"" he said, using Cuban slang for ""whats up?"" ""Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people."" Little progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday or at a state dinner that evening. Instead, the highlights are likely to be Obama's speech on live Cuban television on Tuesday, when he will also meet dissidents and attend an exhibition baseball game between Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays and Cuba's national team.

"Treasury eases restrictions on travel, other dealings with Cuba",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/treasury-eases-restrictions-on-travel-to-cuba/2016/03/15/10a225ec-eaaf-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html,03/15/16,www.washingtonpost.com,"New rules loosening the U.S. embargo against Cuba will allow more Americans to travel there, expand the islands access to the U.S. financial system and permit Cuban athletes to play Major League Baseball in this country without having to defect. The regulations, announced Tuesday just days ahead of President Obamas historic visit to Cuba, are the fifth and potentially most significant round of changes since Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced in December 2014 that the two countries would normalize relations. Diplomatic ties were reestablished last summer after more than half a century of estrangement. Ben Rhodes, White House deputy national security adviser, cited ""strong support"" in this country for Obamas use of his executive powers to dismantle as many financial and travel restrictions as possible until Congress agrees to lift the embargo. ""We also know that our companies and our people are very interested in taking advantage of new opportunities to engage with and empower the Cuban people."" [With Obamas visit, Cubans hope for home run in baseball diplomacy] Obamas goal is to lock in the changed relationship before he leaves office, creating economic, diplomatic and cultural ties that will be difficult for a new administration to undo. Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), both candidates for the GOP presidential nomination and sons of Cuban immigrants, have vowed to reverse the opening. GOP front-runner Donald Trump has said, without elaborating, that he would get ""a better deal with Cuba than Obama."" Republican leaders in Congress have refused to allow votes on a number of pending bills to lift the embargo and all remaining travel restrictions. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) support Obamas policy. Obama arrives in Havana on Sunday evening on the first visit by a U.S. president to Cuba in almost 90 years and the first state visit by a U.S. president. During his two-day stay, he will meet with Castro and members of Cuban ""civil society,"" including political dissidents, and he will hold a roundtable with Cuban private-sector entrepreneurs and U.S. business leaders, dozens of whom will travel there with him under the auspices of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Tuesday, Obama will attend a baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays before leaving to visit Argentina. Critics of the visit charge that the Castro government has done little to reciprocate U.S. gestures. While the number of political protests has been steadily rising, so has the governments efforts to stop them. More than 1,000 demonstrators have been detained each month since the beginning of the year, most of them held for several hours and some physically assaulted. [White House sees Cuba visit as chance to consolidate gains. Critics see caving.] The administration argues that the more opportunities it has to talk to the Cuban government, the more it can push its concerns. ""Even as we pursue this opening between our people, between our governments, we will continue of course to have differences with Cuba on a number of issues, including human rights, which we will be pursuing directly,"" Rhodes said. On an economic level, Obamas efforts to chip away at the embargo have so far left U.S. businesses disappointed at the slow pace of Cuban deal-making. There has been some progress, including an aviation agreement that is likely to result in commercial U.S.-Cuba flights by late summer. Two U.S. companies -- Alabama-based Cleber tractors and Florida Produce -- have been approved by the Treasury Department to open plants in Cuba, although only Cleber has been approved by the Cuban government. But overall, despite visits by dozens of U.S. official and business delegations over the past year, the Cubans have been concerned about the cost of doing business with U.S. companies and remain suspicious of U.S. intentions. Cuba, with a 2014 gross domestic product of $81 billion and imports of only $14 billion in goods and services, ""desperately needs massive flows of foreign investment,"" said Richard E. Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who has written extensively on the Cuban economy. While the island is a ""modest"" market for U.S. exports in the best of circumstances, an expanding Cuban economy ""could make a real difference for many individual U.S. businesses,"" he said. Carlos Gutierrez, a former U.S. commerce secretary and chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerces U.S.-Cuba Business Council, acknowledged the difficulties of doing business, saying that ""its not easy to get to Cuba. Youve got to get a visa, youve got to get the right people in the room, then at least go back a couple of times to fine-tune the deal. It does take time."" ""But what I hear from companies is that when Cuba is fully open, we dont want to be number three or number four"" behind foreign competitors. ""Companies want to be the first in,"" Gutierrez said. Many of the rules announced Tuesday were promulgated in direct response to concerns expressed by U.S. business and the Cuban government, administration officials said. Americans will be allowed to travel to Cuba for individual ""people-to-people"" visits. Previously, they were required to travel with organizations granted Treasury Department licenses in 12 approved categories, including education, religion and culture. Although travel purely for tourism remains prohibited, the new regulations shift the responsibility for legal trips to individuals who declare that they will engage in ""educational"" purposes. [Americans can now plan their own people-to-people trips to Cuba, but what does that mean?] Treasury retains the right to question travelers and demand documentation for up to five years after a trip, but in reality has rarely done so. ""Its basically the honor system on steroids,"" said John Kavulich, head of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, assessing the new regulations. The change was partly driven, he said, by the need to ""fill those planes"" on the commercial airlines that will now fly into Cuba. Non-immigrant Cubans can now be paid for work they do in the United States ""without forcing them to defect,"" according to Andrea Gacki, acting deputy director of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control. While not directed to any particular profession, the measure responds to complaints from Cuba and Major League Baseball that Cuban players have had to renounce ties to their homeland before they could sign contract to play in the United States. When the regulations go into effect Wednesday, U.S. banks will be allowed to process payments to and from Cuba through third countries, including in U.S. dollars, and to open accounts through which dollar remittances can be paid to Cuban residents. ""Restrictions on the dollar have always been a challenge for the Cubans and a challenge for the business community,"" because the need to operate in a third currency has always ""increased the cost of the transactions,"" Kavulich said. Cuba is expected to remove a 10 percent surcharge on all exchanges from dollars into Cuban currency on the island. Separately, the Commerce Department has authorized cargo transit through Cuba, a measure that will allow companies such as FedEx to store in Cuba goods destined for onward delivery. Companies, such as airlines, authorized to have a presence in Cuba will now be allowed to set up offices there. Finally, Commerce has authorized some Cuban exports to the United States, provided that they come from the private sector.

Obama's goal for Cuba trip: Become a source of support,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obamas-goal-for-cuba-trip-become-a-source-of-support/2016/03/16/5aa9877c-ebc5-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html,03/17/16,www.washingtonpost.com,"The first family will travel with President Obama on Sunday to Cuba, where he will deliver a speech to the Cuban people that the administration expects will be broadcast nationwide, meet with political dissidents, entrepreneurs and President Raul Castro, and attend a U.S.-Cuba baseball game. Outlining the trip to reporters, Ben Rhodes, Obamas deputy national security adviser, said that the Tuesday morning speech would be ""as important as anything else hes doing"" on the island. Held at the recently renovated Gran Teatro Alicia Alonso in central Havana, it ""will address the very complicated history between our two countries . . . [and] make clear what his vision is for the future of relations between the United States and Cuba, and the future that we would wish for the Cuban people."" While Obama will not shy away from discussing human rights, ""the difference here is that in the past, because of certain U.S. policies, the message that was delivered in that regard either overtly or implicitly suggested that the United States was seeking to pursue regime change . . . or the United States thought we could dictate the direction of Cuba,"" Rhodes said. Obama will make clear, he said, ""that the United States is not a hostile nation seeking regime change, that in fact we cant be blamed for challenges in Cuba, and that . . . we are there as a source of support for the Cuban people."" People surf the Internet at a public Wi-Fi hotspot in downtown Havana. (Desmond Boylan/AP) One of Obamas goals on the trip is to press the Cuban government to move more quickly to take advantage of trade and other openings that he has brought about through regulatory changes in U.S. law, even as he has been unable to persuade the Republican-controlled Congress to lift the 56-year-old embargo against Cuba. Despite the U.S. changes -- and a steady stream of U.S. business and government delegations to Cuba over the past 15 months since the normalization of ties began -- few actual deals have been signed. Cuba objects to the continuing embargo, and is short of money to purchase U.S. technology and products, even within the small range that is newly permitted. Rhodes said the administration wants ""very much to make the process of normalization irreversible"" beyond Obamas term in office, and will propose ""steps that the Cuban government can take going forward to further open up space for the Cuban people."" Obama will be accompanied by three Cabinet secretaries, at least three dozen members of Congress and a large business delegation. After leaving Cuba late Tuesday, he will spend two days in Argentina, where the administration is trying to build a relationship with newly elected President Mauricio Macri after years of estrangement under previous governments. But most attention has been focused on Cuba, where Obama will be the first U.S. president to set foot in more than 80 years. Critics charge that the president has broken his own pledge not to visit the island until human rights are improved. ""The president has negotiated a deal with the Castros, and I understand his desire to make this his legacy issue,"" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday. ""But there is still a fundamental issue of freedom and democracy at stake that goes to the underlying atmosphere in Cuba and whether or not the Cuban people -- still repressed and still imprisoned -- will benefit from the presidents legacy, or will it be the Castro regime that reaps the benefits."" Menendez cited rising rates of detention and harassment of political dissidents, including the reported arrest this week of Carlos Oliva, head of the youth front of the opposition Patriotic Union of Cuba, three days after he returned to the island after meeting with Rhodes in Miami.",
Che Guevara's son on Obama in Cuba: 'Maybe we can influence US in a positive way',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/che-guevaras-son-on-obama-in-cuba-maybe-we-can-influence-us-in-a-positive-way,03/18/16,www.theguardian.com,"With wary optimism, the son of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara is coming to grips with the visit to Havana this Sunday of a contemporary who just happens to be the leader of the worlds capitalist powerhouse. Camilo Guevara - the eldest son of one of the Cuban revolutions most famous figures - was born within a year of Barack Obama in the early 1960s, when Cuba and the US were starting one of the cold wars most dangerous and enduring conflicts. Guevaras father was executed in Bolivia five years later. Today, in more peaceful but less triumphant times, he is dedicated to protecting Ches legacy and ensuring that his fathers words - and not just his famous portrait - are remembered around the world. But, like many in this island nation, he sees Obamas imminent arrival as much a threat to that legacy as an opportunity. ""Its a historic and very important visit. Its the first time a US president will visit an independent Cuba,"" Guevara tells the Guardian. ""But the US is an empire. Their nature is not to set the table and invite you for a feast. History shows us that every time they set a table, you have to accept you might be poisoned or stabbed in the back. But lets see."" In the outside world, Obamas visit is a peacemaking, groundbreaking trip to a small country that has resisted its superpower neighbour for more than half a century. It appears aimed at starting a triumphant countdown for a president in his final year in office. Fridge magnets, including one of Barack Obama, at a market in Havana ahead of the US presidents visit. Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP US officials say this will be one of the biggest presidential delegations in recent history. As well as his family, Obama will come with four cabinet secretaries, about 40 senators and members of Congress, and dozens of business figures and prominent Cuban Americans. Along with secret service agents, logistics specialists, journalists and the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team (who will play a match that Obama will attend), the official US party will fill 1,200 rooms. The immense size is no accident. This is a visit designed to impress. Among his domestic audience, Obama wants to secure his legacy as a peacemaker. Among his Cuban hosts, he wants to show how much there is to gain from closer ties. Guevara believes his father would have had mixed feelings about the rapprochement. ""You can see that he didnt trust anything coming from the empire,"" he says, referring to his fathers extensive writings. ""But he was a man who felt it was important to have relations with the world, that it was necessary to learn from the positives and the negatives, and he felt that we could also transmit ourselves outwards ... Maybe we can influence the US in a positive way."" We meet at the Che Guevara Study Centre in Havana, which houses a collection of letters, essays and speeches that has been recognised by Unesco as part of the global heritage. In appearance and speech, Camilo Guevara comes across as very much his fathers son. His face gives a clue to how Ches famous looks - now plastered on millions of T-shirts and posters - might have aged if he had not been killed in Bolivia before his 40th birthday. The beard is grey, the flowing locks have receded and the piercing eyes need glasses. Camilo Guevara today. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images He comes across as gregarious, humorous and intense. Although he is not a government spokesman, he reiterates the oft-stated official line that the talks can only succeed if the US respects Cuban sovereignty, engages in talks as an equal and removes the remaining obstacles to closer ties - namely the economic embargo and US navy occupation of Guantanamo Bay. But while the revolutionary ideology is strong, it is not inflexible. ""We have a project as a nation. It has taken us to where we are now. Tomorrow, if we face a different situation, then we have to modify our project,"" he observes. ""If, in the worst case, relations with the US destroy our principles, our ideals, our national project, it means it wasnt strong in the first place."" Change, if it comes, will be at a pace that the Cuban government chooses. Until now, that has led to criticism in the US that Obama has given more than he has got from his deal with the Cuban president, Raul Castro, on 17 December 2014. Most of the movement so far has come from the US side - most recently with this weeks announcement of relaxed currency and travel controls - but it is not entirely a one-way traffic. Cuba has released several dozen political prisoners (though detentions and beatings continue), expanded internet access (although it is still very limited) and entered talks on security, human trafficking and narcotic control. On the big issues - free elections, free press, free assembly - there has been almost nothing, although there is growing speculation that next months Communist party congress could debate further steps forward on economic reform and possibly even a referendum on constitutional reform. So far that is just guesswork. But Obama will try to nudge debate forward in that direction during his speech, the main message of which will be ""Cubas future is for the Cuban people"", but officials stress the goal is not to foster regime change but to remove restrictions that were impeding the islands ability to develop and decide its own fate. Guevara is cautious about the presidents motives. ""I dont know Obama in person. He appears intelligent and sensitive towards the major problems of humanity, but he came to power in an election, not a revolution. He was supported by corporate America,"" Guevara says. ""The colour of skin is one thing, the colour of ideology is another."" Nonetheless, he believes Obama has helped to usher in much needed change that will endure to some degree even after he leaves office. ""The fact is that US-Cuba relations were stuck. Regardless of who becomes president next, things cant get any worse than they were in the past."" The present, however, has its fair share of troubles, which the US could potentially help with. The economy is weak. Shops are often short of basic commodities. Leftwing regional allies that once helped to fill the gaps are now struggling with their own problems. A mural in Havana depicting (from left) Cuban Comunist party founder, Julio Antonio Mella, and revolutionary leaders Camilo Cienfuegos and Che Guevara. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Venezuela, which channelled substantial fuel and aid to Cuba under Hugo Chavez, is now reeling from low oil prices, recession and political turmoil. The Workers party government in Brazil, which helped to bankroll Cubas biggest development project at Mariel port, is distracted by mass protests, economic decline and a debilitating corruption scandal. Leftwing leaders in Argentina and Bolivia have suffered election defeats. Guevara blames the reverses of the Latin American left on cyclical factors: governments lost sympathy when they struggled to realise the hopes of the electorates, but he says this has been compounded by a hostile media, oligarchs and transnational companies. ""This is a temporary setback. [Leftwing movements] havent disappeared or died,"" he says. ""The tide has retreated a few steps, but that is what happens before a tsunami comes surging back."" Almost 50 years after his fathers death, Che remains a figurehead for such movements, but he is also now a commercial icon. Students carry a photograph of Che Guevara at Havanas seafront Malecon. Photograph: Enrique de la Osa / Reuters/Reuters Guevara says part of his objective at the study centre is to ensure that his fathers image is not separated from his ideas and history. ""Che continues to play an important role, but we have to recognise that the symbol of Che means different things in different countries. His image on a flag at a football match in Europe is not the same as his image on the T-shirt of a miner marching for rights in Latin America. Unfortunately there are some who try to separate the image and the history. Its one of our objectives to address that."" Among the documents in the archive is a short goodbye message that Che wrote to his children in the knowledge that he could soon die. It implores them: Above all be sensitive, in the deepest areas of yourselves, to any injustice committed against whoever it may be anywhere in the world."" Guevara is reluctant to share personal reminiscences. ""I have flashes of memory but Im not sure how reliable they are because we fill emptiness with our own visions,"" he says. Instead he prefers to focus on the concrete legacy by distributing his fathers ideas online, in educational materials and exhibitions. All of which are politically toxic to a US president during campaign season. Obama will be cautious about endorsing his hosts. Officials say he will not meet Fidel Castro. Instead, he will be more intent on workshops with entrepreneurs, talks with civil society groups, a baseball match, a speech to the nations youth, and bilateral talks. There is no chance he will visit the Che Guevara Study Centre for a lesson in revolution. For Guevara that is a shame: ""If Obama comes, he might learn something.""",
Obama in Cuba on historic visit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba-idUSKCN0WM04H,03/20/16,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama arrived to small but cheering crowds on Sunday at the start of a historic visit to Cuba that opened a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the islands Communist government after decades of hostility between the former Cold War foes. The three-day trip, the first by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years, is the culmination of a diplomatic opening announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, ending an estrangement that began when the Cuban revolution ousted a pro-American government in 1959. ""Its a historic opportunity to engage directly with the Cuban people,"" Obama told staff at the newly reopened U.S. Embassy who were gathered at a hotel, his first stop after arriving in the afternoon. Groups of Cubans watched the motorcade from balconies and backyards as Obama was driven downtown, where a small crowd of Cubans braved a tropical downpour and tight security. They chanted: ""Viva Obama, Viva Fidel,"" as the president and his family left after eating dinner in a rundown neighborhood. Obama, who abandoned a longtime U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba, wants to make his policy shift irreversible even if a Republican wins the White House in the Nov. 8 election. But major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, and the Democratic presidents critics say the visit is premature. U.S. officials concede the trip may not yield immediate concessions from Cuba on rights and economic freedom. On Sunday, one bystander shouted: ""Down with the blockade,"" in reference to the U.S. embargo in place for 54 years that remains the top irritant for Cubans. Obama, who responded to the shout by raising his right hand, has asked Congress to rescind the embargo but has been blocked by the Republican leadership. Underscoring the ideological divide that persists between Washington and Havana, Cuban police, backed by hundreds of pro-government demonstrators, broke up the regular march of a leading dissident group, the Ladies in White, detaining about 50 people just hours before Obama arrived. AIR FORCE ONE IN CUBA Obama arrived at Havanas Jose Marti International Airport in Air Force One, the presidential jet with ""United States of America"" emblazoned across its fuselage, a sight almost unimaginable not long ago on the island, just 90 miles (145 km) off the coast of Florida. He was met by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, the top Cuban official present. The formal welcoming ceremony will be on Monday when Obama meets the Cuban president at the presidential palace. U.S. officials appeared unfazed by Castros absence from the airport welcome, even though he personally met and greeted Pope Francis in September. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted that Obamas visit was a ""big deal"" but that he got ""no respect."" Obama will hold talks with Castro - but not his brother Fidel, the revolutionary leader - and speak to entrepreneurs on Monday. He meets privately with dissidents, addresses Cubans live on state-run media and attends an exhibition baseball game on Tuesday. The trip carries both symbolism and substance after decades of hostility between Washington and Havana. Traveling with first lady Michelle Obama, her mother and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, Obama took in the sights of the colonial-era neighborhood and was given a tour of Havanas 18th century cathedral by Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a role in secret talks that led to the rapprochement 15 months ago. The Obamas dined at the San Cristobal restaurant, run by an Afro-Cuban as part of a cautious opening to private enterprise since Fidel Castro handed power to his brother in 2008. The trip makes Obama the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge arrived on a battleship in 1928 and may help chip away at barriers to U.S.-Cuba trade and travel. Slideshow ( 30 images ) Since rapprochement, the two sides have restored diplomatic ties and signed commercial deals on telecommunications and scheduled airline service. Obama has used executive authority to loosen trade and travel restrictions to advance his outreach to Cuba, one of his top foreign policy priorities along with the Iran nuclear deal. Cuba still complains about U.S. control of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay under a 1934 lease agreement that Havana says is no longer valid and that Obama has said is not up for discussion. Havana is unhappy with U.S. support for dissidents and anti-communist radio and TV programs beamed into Cuba. Speaking to reporters, Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment minister Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz said before the U.S. presidents arrival that Obamas regulatory moves ""go in the right direction."" But he added: ""We cant reach a normalization of relations with the blockade still in effect."" Slideshow ( 30 images ) '?QUE BOLA CUBA? The Americans in turn criticize one-party rule and repression of political opponents, an issue that aides said Obama would address publicly and privately. Obamas critics at home accuse him of making too many concessions for too little in return from the Cuban government and of using his trip to take an unearned ""victory lap."" Obamas first words to the Cuban people came in a message on Twitter, a social media service that few Cubans can use regularly because of government restrictions on Internet access. ""?Que bola Cuba?"" he said, using Cuban slang for ""whats up?"" ""Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people."" Little progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday or at a state dinner that evening. Instead, the highlights are likely to be Obamas speech on live Cuban television on Tuesday, when he will also meet dissidents and attend an exhibition baseball game between Major League Baseballs Tampa Bay Rays and Cubas national team.",

Havana, Cuba CNN -- Cubas top negotiator with the United States welcomed the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama to the island on Sunday and said officials there would listen with ""respect"" to any criticisms of the communist-run government. ""We are neighbors. Although we might have profound differences, we have many values we share,"" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at Cubas Foreign Ministry. ""Your model isnt perfect. Ours isnt,"" she said. ""But its up to our decisions to make our model more perfect. We can speak openly, without the 'You will change us or I will change you."" Obama will arrive via Air Force One on Sunday afternoon at Havanas Jose Marti International Airport to begin an intense and historic two-day visit to the island that includes meetings with Cuban President Raul Castro and anti-government dissidents. During the visit, Obama will tour the colonial streets of Old Havana, meet with Cuban small-business owners and watch a baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and Cubas national team. Obama will be accompanied by first lady Michelle Obama and their two daughters. The cultural events, U.S. diplomats say, are the administrations attempt to connect with the Cuban people and counter the longtime portrayal in Cuban state media of the United States as a hostile force lurking just off Cubas shores. On Saturday, the U.S. Embassy in Havana released a video that showed Cuban comedian Panfilo joking with Obama about his visit and some of the absurdities of life in Cuba. U.S. diplomats say the highlight of the trip will be when Obama delivers an address to the Cuban people on his new policy of engagement. He is expected to extend an olive branch to the Cuban people and also take the Cuban government to task for the lack of civil liberties on the island. Obama has said he wants to cement ties with Cuba so that whoever follows him as president could not reverse the policy change. Several Republican candidates, including front-runner Donald Trump, have said they would close the newly reopened U.S. Embassy and take a tougher line with the Cuban government. Vidal said that Cuban officials hope whoever is the next president will continue Obamas policy of engagement. ""No one can say now how this next president will think or make decisions on issues concerning Cuba and the U.S.,"" she said. ""What I would hope is that whoever is president conducts policy that reflects the majority of those who vote for him."" Vidal said while not all Cuban officials support warming relations, and some continue to view the United States with suspicion, she feels that if he were alive, the thaw would be welcomed by one icon of the Cuban revolution: Che Guevara. Guevara, one of the leaders of the Cuban revolution, who was killed in Bolivia by U.S.-backed forces, was famous for his disdain for capitalism. But Vidal said that wouldnt have prevented Guevara from wanting improved relations with his old foe. ""He wasnt that different from us, to think that its beneficial,"" Vidal said. ""Normal relations means you are ready to respect the other partys differences and have a peaceful coexistence.""",
"As Obama Arrives, Cuba Tightens Grip on Dissent",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/world/americas/cuba-obama-visit-havana-dissidents.html,03/20/16,www.nytimes.com,"Mr. Sanchez, who is among the dissidents expected to meet with the president on Tuesday, said that in the first two weeks of March, 526 critics of the government had been detained. While dissidents are often held for a few hours for printing fliers, staging street protests or just planning them, he and others said Mr. Obamas visit had set in motion a broader campaign. On Saturday, Mr. Sanchez himself was held for three and a half hours at the Havana airport. He said he had been separated from his wife; sent to a cold, windowless room; and told that he was not being ""detained"" but rather ""retained."" ""Can I make a phone call?"" he said he had asked, as officials made copies of every document in his bag. ""No,"" came the reply. ""Its the climate of intimidation the government is creating for Obamas visit,"" said Mr. Sanchez, a graying, steady critic of President Raul Castros government. ""Right now what you see is preventive repression, so it does not occur to anyone to say anything to Obama while he is here."" For decades, Cuban officials have treated every interaction with the United States as a test of sovereignty, and their approach to Mr. Obamas visit is partly an effort to project competence, confidence and a new commitment to a calibrated friendship.",
'The oppression is high': Cuban police break up protest ahead of Obama's visit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/20/cuba-obama-visit-anti-castro-protesters-clash,03/20/16,www.theguardian.com,"Cuban police forcibly broke up a pro-democracy demonstration and arrested several dozen activists on Sunday, just hours before Barack Obama was to arrive in Havana as the first US president to visit Cuba in almost 90 years. The protesters, from the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White) and other opposition groups, were bundled into buses and police vans after a shouting match with pro-Castro supporters during their usual weekly demonstration near the Santa Rita church. ""My son and his wife are in jail now. They all are. The police were very violent,"" Glavys Fernandez, the mother of leading opposition figure Antonio Rodiles, told the Guardian. ""Its the same every week. The oppression is very high."" Earlier in the day, her son, who helped form the Todos Marchamos (""We all march"") campaign, predicted what was to come as he addressed journalists before the protest. ""I have been arrested more than 50 times in the past year,"" Rodiles said. ""The police have broken my nose and my eardrum. There are many of them surrounding us again today. But we want to send a clear message to Obama. We need to show the reality we are living in."" The protesters carried banners, proclaiming: ""Obamas trip to Cuba isnt for fun. No to violations of human rights."" Others chanted, ""Obama, we have a dream: a Cuba without Castros."" Antonio Rodiles: 'I have been arrested more than 50 times in the past year. Photograph: The Guardian ""Ive been detained and beaten countless times,"" said Eralidis Frometa Polanco, an activist who turned up in the all-white clothes of the demonstrators, who march silently along 5th Avenue each week in protest at the lack of freedom of expression. ""I have no hope at all of progress as a result of Obamas visit. He doesnt know what it is like to live in a dictatorship."" A passing cyclist, Josoa Gomez, who said he was a university professor, accused her and the other protesters of being liars, mercenaries and ingrates who failed to recognise the benefits of Cuban society, including free education and healthcare. The tensions escalated up until the arrests. The confrontation highlights what is likely to be one of the most contentious issues of the US presidents visit: human rights and pro-democracy reforms. Many Cuban opposition activists complain the rapprochement process that started in 17 December 2014 gives the Castro government legitimacy and greater access to international credit. They say releases of hundreds of prisoners, which have been hailed as the most tangible signs of change since then, are illusory, because convictions have not been pardoned and the activists remain under a legal cloud. Human Rights Watch said the situation for civil rights activists has not improved since the rapprochement began between Obama and Raul Castro. They noted that during Pope Franciss visit to the island last September, police detained between 100 and 150 dissidents. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation reported more than 8,500 cases of arbitrary detention in 2015, and more than 2,500 in the first two months of 2016. Democracy activists in the one-party state are pushing for a range of reforms, including free elections, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and an end to repression of activists. They want Obama to lobby on their behalf. US officials say the president, who will meet civil rights activists and give a speech on Tuesday, is not in Havana to make demands, but to encourage reforms that have already begun, particularly in the area of economic liberalisation. However, they say he will talk candidly about human rights and the need for participation in decision making. Rosa Maria Paya: 'I hope he will support the Cuban people and not just talk to the leaders and have his picture taken. Photograph: ZIPI/EPA ""The main message of his speech will be that Cubas future is for the Cuban people to decide. The goal is not to foster regime change,"" said a state department official. ""President Obama wants to show that the challenges Cubans face are not the result of US policy."" No political conditions have been set for the visit and there is no expectation of a quid pro quo exchange from the Cubans for the US decision last week to relax currency and and travel restrictions. Change, if it comes at all, is more likely at next months Communist Party Congress. One possibility is a referendum on the constitution that would allow Cuban voters to set the political direction for their country ahead of 2018, when Castro has said he plans to step down. ""There is the possibility of reform in April, but we must understand that the group in power for 57 years want to remain in power and keep their privileges,"" said democracy campaigner Rosa Maria Paya, who has launched a petition calling for Obama to support the idea of a referendum during his visit to the island. ""He should ask for the specific tool of a plebiscite so that Cuban people can decide their future for the first time in 60 years,"" she said. ""I hope he will support the Cuban people and not just talk to the leaders and have his picture taken."" Paya wants the US president to make a symbolic gesture against impunity by laying flowers at the grave of her father, a leading democracy campaigner who died in mysterious circumstances in 2012. Cuban authorities say Oswaldo Paya died in a car crash. His family contends that government agents were following him and may have forced him off the road. They believe he is a victim of terror tactics used by the communist government to maintain one-party rule. ""We Cubans know what to do but we cant do it alone because the Cuban government has weapons, and they are willing to use them - as we saw with the murder of my father,"" Paya said. ""We need the support of the international community."" Before his detention, Rodiles argued Obama should stress political freedom and insist that the government in Havana ratify the United Nations Covenant on Human Rights. ""Raul Castro has said he will move aside in 2018 and this has created the expectation of elections. But the real transfer is taking place right now so by the time Castro steps down, power will have already switched,"" he said. ""How can there be a proper referendum without freedom of expression, without access to a free TV and a free press? They will never allow me to go on television and debate the issues.""",
Obama begins historic visit to Cuba,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-cubans-wait-for-obama-tension-and-excitement-on-havanas-streets/2016/03/20/78726756-eed1-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0_story.html,03/20/16,www.washingtonpost.com,"President Obama arrived in Cuba on Sunday afternoon, a journey of only 90 miles from U.S. shores that took more than half a century to complete. Stepping off Air Force One under drizzling skies, the president held an umbrella over his wife, Michelle, as he was greeted by senior Cuban officials. The Obamas, including the presidents two daughters and his mother-in-law, were met on the tarmac by Bruno Rodriguez, Cubas foreign minister, and Josefina Vidal, the head of the U.S. section of Cubas Foreign Ministry, as well as Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the senior U.S. diplomat in Cuba. The official welcoming session will take place Monday morning when Obama meets with Cuban President Raul Castro at the presidential palace. [Obamas goal for Cuba trip: Become a source of support] Obamas trip here -- the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928 -- comes amid high anticipation and anxiety on the island within both the Communist government and its political opposition. The government hopes the two-day visit will allow it to reap benefits without ceding control, while dissidents on the island want it to speed the pace of change. Since re-establishing diplomatic ties with Cuba, the U.S. has made it easier for Americans to travel to the island nation. Here is what you need to know about changes that make it easier to visit Cuba. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) An affirmation of his larger foreign policy vision, Obama hopes that reaching out to Cuba will encourage a generational evolution in one of the United States most bitter and long-standing adversaries. Just hours before his arrival, there were familiar signs that change will not come easily. As Sunday-morning Mass ended at Havanas Santa Rita church, several dozen women in white T-shirts filed out, assembled in rows and began walking silently down the street. A block away, hundreds of uniformed security personnel and plain-clothed men and women stood waiting. They met at the corner in a melee of shouting and manhandling. The women in white went limp on the pavement, shouting ""Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!"" and throwing leaflets into the air. The security teams half-dragged, half-carried them to waiting buses. [Timeline: A difficult history between U.S. and Cuba] A number of men marching with the women were chased, thrown to the curb and handcuffed. As the buses drove away, the protesters lifted defiant fists through the windows while the plain-clothed crowd chanted ""This is Fidels street!"" The Sunday-morning demonstrations of the Ladies in White dissident group are regular occurrences in Havana. The large size of the security force and the fact that the entire operation was conducted in front of international television cameras were not. All the cross-currents and contradictions of Cuba and its changing relationship with the United States have been on display over the past two days. On Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard fished out 18 Cubans trying to reach Florida on homemade rafts. They reported that nine others had drowned on the journey. Late Saturday, the Starwood hotel chain signed a mega-deal with the Cuban government to manage three hotels on the island, the first U.S. entrance into the tourist business here in more than 60 years. On Sunday morning, Cubans crowded around their televisions to watch a hilarious phone conversation Obama taped Friday with the islands best-known comedian. [Did you or your family immigrate to the U.S. from Cuba? Tell us what you brought with you] Hours later, the Ladies in White were attacked. ""We want to see results"" from the U.S. opening, said Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of Cubas largest dissident organization, the Cuban Patriotic Union. ""But Obama himself has said not to expect spectacular results . . . and he has been exactly right."" Ferrer and several other dissident leaders who gathered Sunday morning -- all of whom have been invited to a private meeting with Obama on Tuesday morning -- argued among themselves about the pace of change and the intransigence of the government. They agreed that they are not expecting short-term liberalization. But, they said, the combined weight of the U.S. opening and the coming generational shift replacing Cubas aging leadership would inevitably bring down the system here. ""Its already easier to criticize Raul than it was Fidel,"" Ferrer said of the current Castro president, and his brother and predecessor. ""The next will be easier still."" Raul Castro has said he will step down in 2018. ""In the long run, this could be like a poison steak for the regime,"" he said of normalization. ""It will taste good, but youll eventually get a stomachache."" The Obama administration ""knows that Fidel Castro is about to turn 90,"" and that Raul is only a few years behind, said Guillermo Farinas, head of the United Anti-Totalitarian Forum. ""A new generation is coming, with ever less moral authority"" to claim it is promoting a popular revolution that took place long before most Cubans were born. Nearly a dozen dissidents are expected at the meeting with Obama. They have been told they will be picked up at their residences by U.S. officials and taken to the U.S. Embassy two hours before the meeting, presumably to avoid the past government practice of sequestering in their homes those it does not want meeting with prominent foreign visitors. At the embassy, they will watch and listen to Obamas broadcast speech to the nation. Most said they were going to wait to hear what he has to tell them before deciding what they want to ask the U.S. president. ""Ten minutes will be enough for him to say a lot of things,"" Ferrer said of the speech, scheduled to last 40 minutes. ""Its a unique opportunity,"" he said. ""Every Cuban is going to want to see if he projects an image of non- complicity with the government, if he will be transparent."" [What the Cuban government wants from Obama] Far from Sundays protests, Obama and his family first traveled to the Melia Habana hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Miramar, where he met with the U.S. Embassy staff. On his first day here, Obama tried out his Spanish. ""?Que bola Cuba?"" he tweeted on landing, using a particularly Cuban Spanish phrase meaning ""Whats up?"" To the embassy staff, he said ""?Como andan?"" -- ""How are you doing?"" The Obamas took a brief walking tour Sunday evening of Old Havana, the capitals 500-year-old historic quarter and a World Heritage Site. Images of their visit to its spiffed-up colonial plazas and colonnaded streetscapes are likely to stir up even more interest among would-be American travelers. As they visited the Plaza de Armas with umbrellas under a steady rain, crowds nearby chanted ""USA! USA!"" Throngs of Cubans also watched as the family entered Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Cathedral to meet with Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a critical role in secret talks between the two countries. Afterward, the Obamas dined at San Cristobal, a privately owned restaurant. The first familys tour was limited to the renovated part of Old Havana. The larger, unreconstructed part of the neighborhood, which tourists rarely enter, is filled with families living in crowded, crumbling tenements. Local resident Alberto Moreno, 35, a cook at a brewery, said earlier in the day that he thought Obamas visit would show that ""Cuba is not the disaster that people in the United States think it is."" ""This will probably be the first country Obama visits where there is no one protesting him,"" said Moreno -- and given that public demonstrations are banned, he is almost certainly right. Obama seemed to have made a favorable impression ahead of his arrival by appearing in a skit with Cubas best-known comedian, Panfilo. In a split-screen video shot Friday, the two discussed his trip by phone, and the dimwitted Panfilo offered the U.S. president a ride from the airport and use of his double bed -- warning Obama that Michelle would rest more comfortably on the side without a spring sticking out. Havana resident Deroy Aponte, 28, who watched the video on Telesur, the Venezuelan network that is broadcast full time here, said hed never seen a powerful political figure do something like that. ""It made a big impression on me,"" he said. [Obamas soft diplomacy in Cuba: A comedy skit] The U.S. president seems to be ""open-minded, reasonable and someone capable of putting himself in others shoes,"" said Aponte, who works as a repairman for cigar-making machinery. But for Americans wanting to visit Cuba, the contradictions are stark. As the Ladies in White began their ill-fated march, several held a banner that read ""Obama: Traveling to Cuba isnt fun. No more human rights violations.""

Obama embarks on historic Cuba visit,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/3/21/obama-embarks-on-historic-cuba-visit,03/21/16,www.aljazeera.com,"US president arrives in Havana on a three-day trip a year after diplomatic ties were restored. US President Barack Obama embarked on a historic trip to Cuba on Sunday, more than a year after Washington reset its foreign policy towards the island following decades of Cold War animosity that almost led to a nuclear war. The three-day trip - the first by a US president in 88 years - was unthinkable until Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed in December 2014 to re-establish diplomatic ties. The US broke off ties with the communist nation of 11 million when Cuban revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro ousted a pro-American government in 1959. On Sunday evening, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez met Obama at the Jose Marti Airport after Air Force One touched down in Havana, 145 kilometres from the southern US state of Florida. Cuban police, meanwhile, broke up the regular march of a leading dissident group, the Ladies in White, detaining about 50 people hours before Obama arrived. About 200 protesters have been briefly arrested in the past few days. Obama will meet government critics on Tuesday. The leader of the Ladies in White, Berta Soler, has been invited. She was among those detained on Sunday. The Cuban government dismisses dissidents as mercenaries seeking to destabilise the country. Plainclothes police blanketed the capital, Havana, with security while public works crews laid down asphalt to fill potholes, as the island nation prepared a red-carpet welcome for Obama and his family. Cuba: History is on Obamas side Little progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday. Instead, the highlights are likely to be Obamas speech on live Cuban television on Tuesday when he will also attend a baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Welcome signs with images of Obama alongside Castro popped up in colonial Old Havana, where the president and his family will tour later on Sunday. Since rapprochement, the two sides have restored diplomatic ties, signed commercial deals on telecommunications, and scheduled airline services. Major differences remain, however, notably the 54-year-old economic embargo of Cuba, which it calls a blockade. Obama has asked Congress to rescind it but has been blocked by the Republican leadership. Instead, he has used executive authority to loosen trade and travel restrictions to advance his outreach to Cuba, one of his top foreign policy priorities along with the Iran nuclear deal. IN PICTURES: Changing face of Cuba Obamas critics at home accuse him of making too many concessions for too little in return from the Cuban government, and of using his trip to take a premature ""victory lap"" to polish his foreign policy legacy. The US and Cuba: Obsession But Obamas more practical goal is to do everything he can in his final 10 months in office to make his Cuba policy changes irreversible, even if a Republican wins the White House in Novembers election. Cuba also complains about the continued occupation of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, which Obama has said is not up for discussion, as well as US support for dissidents and anti-communist radio and TV programmes beamed into Cuba. Cuba has defended its universal healthcare and education as human rights and criticises the US record on race relations and the Guantanamo Bay military prison. The Americans, in turn, criticise one-party rule and repression of political opponents. On the eve of Obamas visit, a US hospitality company announced its first business deal in Cuba since the 1959 revolution, while online lodging service Airbnb said it would now allow travellers from around the world to book stays in private homes in the island nation known for its beautiful beaches and heritage buildings.",
Obama on Cuba: Differences Remain but Change in Sight,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/u-s-cuba-relations/obama-cuba-schedule-monday-includes-meeting-raul-castro-n542556,03/21/16,www.nbcnews.com,"Emerging from a historic meeting with his Cuban counterpart, President Obama said Monday that he remained concerned about the communist island's record on human rights but said the two countries had enough in common to negotiate a slow normalization of relations. ""When we share our deepest beliefs on an attitude of mutual respect, then we can both learn and make the lives of our people better,"" Obama said in a joint appearance with Cuban President Raul Castro. He also said the United States respected Cuba's sovereignty. ""The future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans and not by anyone else,"" he said. Castro spoke before Obama, saying his country remained committed to normalizing relations but reiterated that it could only happen if Congress ends a decades-old economic blockade. The blockade, Castro said, is ""the most outstanding obstacle to our economic development."" In a not-so-subtle dig at critics of Cuba's harsh treatment of dissidents, Castro insisted that Cuba ""defended human rights"" and suggested that America should practice what it preached on universal access to health care, equal pay, education and other issues. Related: In Cuba and U.S., Expectations Are Mixed on Obama's Historic Trip During a news conference afterwards, Castro said that he would release any political prisoners currently in custody -- so long as he was given ""a name or names,"" he said. ""If we have them, they will be released before tonight ends,"" he said, adding that no country complies with all human rights ""instruments"" and that the issue should not be used for ""political confrontation."" ""It is not right,"" he said. ""It is not correct."" Obama rolled with Castros jabs, saying that he welcomed the Cuban president ""commenting on some of the areas where were falling short."" He also pointed out that having ""fierce disagreements"" on human rights wasnt particular to Cuba. China, Burma and Vietnam were examples where ""engaging frankly"" and ""clearly"" on the issue served as a better strategy than ""rigid disengagement."" Still, without progress on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, for instance, human rights issues would remain a ""very powerful irritant"" to the ""full flowering of a relationship"" between the two countries, Obama said. Obama sought to show where the U.S. and Cuba were already forging strong bonds: on travel, trade, agriculture and the internet. But when it came to American politics -- and a question about who Castro would prefer from the crop of presidential hopefuls -- the Cuban leader declined to weigh in. ""I cannot vote in the United States,"" he said. The two-hour meeting marked the culmination of Obama's first full day in Cuba, which began with a trip into the heart of the Communist island nation's seat of power: a visit to a local hero's memorial. Then he walked to the the Palace of the Revolution. Seeking to press Cuba into speedier economic reforms and improved human rights, Obama is the first American president to visit since Calvin Coolidge nearly 90 years ago. His bilateral discussion with Castro was not their first meeting, but was the most meaningful by far. Obama has made a priority of seeking more help for large and small businesses -- including the hundreds of thousands of Cubans who have taken advantage of incremental economic opportunities and become entrepreneurs. Castro, brother of former president Fidel Castro, has insisted that Congress lift a decades-old economic embargo and pull the military out of Guantanamo Bay. Looming over the visit is the Castro regime's treatment of dissidents. Civil rights advocates said there were signs of a crackdown on some of the most outspoken of them in advance Obama's arrival, and authorities have not let up on their arrests of protesters who take part in weekly demonstrations. The president's opponents, including Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, who is of Cuban heritage, have criticized Obama for not being more outspoken about the plight of dissidents. Obama will likely bring up human rights in a Tuesday speech to the Cuban people. After those remarks, he will meet with a group that is expected to include dissidents and members of the political opposition. PHOTOS: Cuba Welcomes Obama for Historic Presidential Trip Obama's arrival in Havana Sunday afternoon was the result of a long effort to thaw the United States' antagonistic relationship with Cuba, which dates to the country's 1959 Communist revolution. The Obama administration has made incremental moves to loosen certain economic blockades, making it a little easier for Americans to visit and for money to pass between the countries. But more sweeping limits set by Congress endure. The less controversial stops in Obama itinerary this week include a baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team, a visit with Havana's archbishop and events with other members of Cuban society.

The president signed the visitor's book. According to the White House, this is what he wrote: ""It is a great honor to pay tribute to Jose Marti, who gave his life for independence of his homeland. His passion for liberty, freedom, and self-determination lives on in the Cuban people today.""",
"'Historic visit, historic opportunity': Obama arrives in Cuba, becomes first US president to do so in 88 years-World News , Firstpost",http://www.firstpost.com/world/historic-visit-historic-opportunity-obama-arrives-in-cuba-becomes-first-president-to-land-in-cuba-in-88-years-2687158.html,03/21/16,www.firstpost.com,"Stepping into history, President Barack Obama opened an extraordinary visit to Cuba on Sunday, eager to push decades of acrimony deeper into the past and forge irreversible ties with America's former adversary Havana: Stepping into history, President Barack Obama opened an extraordinary visit to Cuba on Sunday, eager to push decades of acrimony deeper into the past and forge irreversible ties with America's former adversary. ""This is a historic visit and a historic opportunity,"" Obama said as he greeted staff of the new US Embassy in Havana. Air Force One touched down on a rainy, overcast day in the Cuban capital. The president was joined by wife Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha. Obama was greeted by top Cuban officials -- but not President Raul Castro. The Cuban leader frequently greets major world figures upon their arrival at Jose Marti International Airport, but was absent on the tarmac. Instead, he planned to greet Obama on Monday at the Palace of the Revolution. Obama's whirlwind trip is a crowning moment in his and Castro's ambitious effort to restore normal relations between their countries. While deep differences persist, the economic and political relationship has changed rapidly in the 15 months since the leaders vowed a new beginning. After greeting embassy staff, Obama and his family toured Old Havana by foot, despite a heavy downpour. They walked gingerly on the slippery wet stones in the square in front of the Havana Cathedral. A few hundred people gathered in the square erupted in applause and shouted Obama's name as the first family stepped forward. The Obamas then dined at a privately-owned restaurant in a bustling, working class neighbourhood. Jubilant crowds surged toward the president's heavily fortified motorcade as it inched through the San Cristobal restaurant. For more than 50 years, Cuba was an unimaginable destination for a US president, as well as most American citizens. The US severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 after Fidel Castro's revolution sparked fears of communism spreading to the Western Hemisphere. Domestic politics in both countries contributed to the continued estrangement well after the Cold War ended. ""He wanted to come to Cuba with all his heart,"" 79-year-old Odilia Collazo said in Spanish as she watched Obama's arrival live on state television. ""Let God will that this is good for all Cubans. It seems to me that Obama wants to do something good before he leaves."" Ahead of Obama's arrival, counter-protesters and police broke up an anti-government demonstration by the Ladies in White group, whose members were taken into custody by female police officers in a scene that plays out in Havana each Sunday. They're typically detained briefly and then released. Obama's visit was highly anticipated in Cuba, where workers furiously cleaned up the streets in Old Havana and gave buildings a fresh coat of paint ahead of his arrival. American flags were raised alongside the Cuban colors in parts of the capital, an improbable image for those who have lived through a half-century of bitterness between the two countries. Many Cubans stayed home in order to avoid extensive closures of main boulevards. The city's seaside Malecon promenade was largely deserted Sunday morning except for a few cars, joggers, fishermen and pelicans. The president's schedule in Cuba is jam-packed, including an event with U.S. and Cuban entrepreneurs. But much of Obama's visit was about appealing directly to the Cuban people and celebrating the island's vibrant culture. ""I don't think that the Cuban people are going to be bewitched by North American culture,"" Gustavo Machin, Cuba's deputy director of US affairs, told AP. ""We don't fear ties with the United States."" A highlight of Obama's visit comes Tuesday when he joins Castro and a crowd of baseball-crazed Cubans for a game between the beloved national team and Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays. The president also planned a speech at the Grand Theatre of Havana laying out his vision for greater freedoms and more economic opportunity in Cuba. Two years after taking power in 2008, Castro launched economic and social reforms that appear slow-moving to many Cubans and foreigners, but are lasting and widespread within Cuban society. The changes have allowed hundreds of thousands of people to work in the private sector and have relaxed limits on cellphones, Internet and Cubans' comfort with discussing their country's problems in public, for example. The Cuban government has been unyielding, however, on making changes to its single-party political system and to the strict limits on media, public speech, assembly and dissent. Obama will spend some time talking with Cuban dissidents. The White House said such a meeting was a prerequisite for the visit. But there were no expectations that he would leave Cuba with significant pledges from the government to address Washington's human rights concerns. A major focus for Obama was pushing his Cuba policy to the point it will be all but impossible for the next president to reverse it. That includes highlighting new business deals by American companies, including hotel chains Starwood and Marriott and online lodging service Airbnb. AP",
Barack Obama: 'Change going to happen' in Cuba,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/3/21/barack-obama-change-going-to-happen-in-cuba,03/21/16,www.aljazeera.com,"But US president acknowledges ""significant differences"" on human rights and civil liberties amid one-party state rule. US President Barack Obama said political change is inevitable on the communist island of Cuba as he met counterpart Raul Castro on Monday in Havana during a historic visit. Obama, who arrived on the communist island a day earlier with his family, is the first US president to visit in 88 years, more than a year after he and Castro surprised the world in December 2014 by announcing that their countries would begin normalising relations. ""Change is going to happen here and I think that Raul Castro understands that,"" he said in an interview with US broadcaster ABC News. Obama acknowledged, however, it was not going to occur ""overnight"". ""But what we have seen is the reopening of the embassy and although we still have significant differences around human rights and individual liberties inside of Cuba, we felt that coming now would maximise our ability to prompt more change,"" the president said.

The comments came a day after dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators were arrested during a protest before Obamas arrival. They were held briefly before being released. On Monday, Obamas first stop on his first full day in Cuba was Revolutionary Square, home to a memorial to Cuba independence hero Jose Marti. Cuba eyes US market for expected medical tourism boom In a long-anticipated moment, Obama and Castro shook hands warmly and smiled for the cameras as they greeted each other. The two countries have moved towards normalising relations after a breakdown following the 1959 communist revolution led by former Cuban President Fidel Castro. Successive US governments have tried to oust the Cuban leadership, most notably during the CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961. Obama also revealed on Monday that he plans to announce while in Cuba that tech giant Google has struck a deal to upgrade the paltry internet access on the island. Newman said the Obamas visit had excited Cubans, many hopeful of what the newly re-established ties could bring. ""Many Cubans were actually saying they needed to pinch themselves, that they could not really believe that an American president was finally coming to their country,"" she said. ""People want to know what the president is going to say ... he will be addressing the Cuban people on Tuesday [and] this message will be broadcast live on Cuban television.""

""For 50 years, they have used American aggression or interests in regime change as the excuse for why they had to guard against dissent inside of Cuba. ... As normalization occurs, that excuse is taken away,"" Obama said. ""What I indicated to him is that we can't force changes on Cuba -- but what we can do and will continue to do is to stand up to the rights that we consider to be universal."" The interview aired today on ""World News Tonight with David Muir"" at 6:30 p.m. ET and will air on ""Nightline"" at 12:35 a.m. The extended interview will be available online at ABCNews.com Today, Obama attended bilateral talks with Castro, after an official welcoming ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital of Havana. The president's full day of events in Cuba marked the first time a sitting U.S. president had visited the island nation since Calvin Coolidge arrived by boat 88 years ago. ""I believe that President Castro truly wants change,"" Obama told Muir today. ""I do not believe that President Castro wants to upend the Union Party or the system they have. And I think that's going to require a transition that happens over the course of the next generation of Cubans."" The US commander in chief said that in talks today he'd been clear with Castro that he would not ""compare apples and oranges"" when discussing the US and Cuba. ""Whenever they hear criticism of the United States, their argument is that 'OK, we may be, in your view, short on some democratic practices. On the other hand, you guys still engage in the death penalty or racial discrimination.' ... They'll tick off a list,"" Obama said. ""Here's the point. ... We should not use our shortcomings as a way of deflecting the kinds of repression that happens here."" He said that in his conversations with Castro, he'd even referred to his own experiences as US president, with protesters demonstrating outside of the White House. Obama said he considered the demonstrations ""part of democracy"" and not something to fear. ""My view is that people have a right to express their differences. Now, one of the things I said to President Castro, and I truly believe this, is that if they were less fearful of dissent, then not only might they be able to improve government but I suspect that they could enhance their legitimacy in the eyes of the Cuban people,"" Obama said. ""Better to listen, hear them out. And he may discover that in fact they have something to teach him."" The president's trip comes 15 months after he announced the restoration of diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Cuba. In the last year, U.S. officials have worked to reopen Cuba to America with historic agreements, including direct flight agreements. Obama also plans to speak to entrepreneurs in the country. Obama is joined by a massive U.S. delegation during his visit; 39 members of Congress including five Republicans will be following his movements. The president also plans to address the Cuban people directly in a historic speech Tuesday and will take in an exhibition game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National team. Obama told Muir that with more Americans traveling to Cuba, he expected significant change to come to the country. ""What you're gonna end up seeing is a freer and more prosperous Cuba,"" he said.",
Castro demands return of Guantanamo Bay during historic Obama visit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/raul-castro-demands-return-guantanamo-bay-obama-visit,03/21/16,www.theguardian.com,"President Raul Castro of Cuba demanded that Barack Obama hand back Guantanamo Bay and fully end the US trade embargo as their historic first summit in Havana witnessed an unexpectedly spirited clash of political values. Despite emotional scenes of reconciliation that earlier saw the Star Spangled Banner played to spine-tingling effect by a Cuban band in Revolution Square, the two leaders made clear that rapprochement had only come so far. ""There are profound differences between our countries that will not go away,"" said Castro as he turned the tables on the question of human rights and criticised the US for its failures to ensure universal healthcare and equal pay for women. ""In our view, civil, economic, social and cultural rights are indivisible, interdependent and universal,"" he added. ""We find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and secure the right to healthcare, equal pay and the rights of children. We oppose political double standards in the approach to human rights."" The Cuban leader also angrily rejected questions by a US journalist who questioned his countrys human rights record, a subject he said should not be ""politicised"". When asked why Cuba still held political prisoners, a visibly irritated Castro responded by asking: ""What political prisoners? Give me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately. ""If we have those political prisoners they will be released before tonight."" The Cuban government released 53 political prisoners soon after announcing the restoration of diplomatic relations with the US in December, but human rights groups say that dozens more remain in the countrys prisons. Obama agreed that the two countries still had much to disagree about and said the two had ""frank and candid"" exchanges during nearly three hours of bilateral meetings earlier on Monday. ""After five very difficult decades, the relationship between our two countries will not be transformed overnight,"" said the US president. ""We continue to have significant differences ... and that includes democracy and human rights."" But the US president stressed that the ""normalising"" of relations with Cuba should allow discussion of such disagreements - some of which he personally sympathised with. ""President Castro spoke about what he believes are shortcomings in the US: around basic healthcare and race relations. We welcome that constructive dialogue."" ""Cubas destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other country,"" Obama added. ""Cuba has great pride and the future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans ... but the US will continue to speak out on behalf of democracy and human rights."" Obamas conciliatory remarks - in which he predicted Congress would soon lift the embargo - may anger critics back home, who claim he has given away too much for too little by restoring diplomatic relations without guarantees of political reform. But the president, who steps down in nine months time, insisted the US needed to play a longer game. ""We might disagree today on something that we may agree on tomorrow,"" Obama said. The White House suggested the administration would not immediately respond to Castros call for a list of people who the US claims are political prisoners. National security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters at a briefing in Havana: ""I have shared many such lists with the Cuban government over two and a half years of dealing with them. We shared 53 who they released around the time of the December 15 announcement. Some more were addressed ahead of this visit. However there are certainly additional names that we raise almost every time we meet."" ""Its not their lack of awareness, its their belief that they are not political prisoners: that they are in prison for crimes and offences against Cuban law,"" added Rhodes. ""What we have said is, if someone is detained for a non-violent political offence, like expressing yourself or taking part in protest, those people are inherently political prisoners."" The White House also insisted Obama will not be meeting Fidel Castro this week, despite an interview in which the president said he was open to the idea. ""On this trip the president will not be meeting Fidel,"" said Rhodes. ""He was speaking generally about the potential."" The contrasting styles of the consummate communicator Obama and the gruff former general Castro made for absorbing viewing, particularly among a domestic audience hungry for news of progress in relations. Restaurant waiter Victor Aguilar said it was unusual to see Castro asked about human rights at a press conference. ""Its good, really good. Cuba needs a free media,"" said the 21-year-old, who hopes to go to the US for the first time later this year. ""Its a change and we need a change."" Jean Robert, who works in a photography studio in central Havana, said both leaders came across well. ""Raul and Obama are trying to do the right thing,"" he said. ""I was very happy that they talked about political prisoners and internet freedom. Thats really important for us. If Raul says he will release prisoners, then he will. I believe him."" Pro-democracy activist Rosa Maria Paya said the spectacle was ridiculous but revealing, particularly with regard to questions on human rights. ""This is the first time I have seen Raul trying to avoid these kind of questions ... This regime and the dynastic old general can no longer hide their oppressive methods. From now on the democratic world should choose between accepting the rules of the Cuban dynasty or, as Obama, said, supporting the right of all Cubans to decide."" She said she hoped the US president will make a still clearer statement of support for a national plebiscite in his speech tomorrow. On a day many thought they would never live to see, the presidents of the former cold war enemies grinned as they shook hands in Havana ahead of a summit that aims to foster a new era in bilateral relations. The genial encounter between Obama and Castro at the presidential palace was the highpoint of an emotionally and historically charged morning that also saw a Cuban military band play the US national anthem and US officials standing respectfully in front of giant portraits of revolutionaries Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. Some among the huge visiting delegation of officials and journalists said they felt chills down their spines at a wreath-laying ceremony in which Obama paid his respects to Jose Marti, the intellectual leader of the Cuban independence movement in the 19th century. ""It is a great honour to pay tribute to Jose Marti, who gave his life for independence of his homeland,"" Obama wrote in the museum guest book. ""His passion for liberty, freedom and self-determination lives on in the Cuban people today."" The show of respect for the host nations sovereignty set the stage for a visit that aims to reset neighbourly ties that have long been marked by confrontation and threats. No serving US president has visited Havana since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. In the intervening years, a revolution led by Fidel Castro brought a communist one-party government to Cuba, briefly brought the nuclear frontier of the cold war to the doorstep of the United States, and led to a US embargo that has contributed to the dismal condition of the Cuban economy today. Having broken the ice with a surprise bilateral deal with President Castro on 17 December 2014, the Obama White House has steadily relaxed controls on trade, travel and finance. This weeks visit is the most tangible sign yet of warming ties and ensures that Washingtons new Cuba policy will be one of the presidents main legacies. Obama rolled into the Cuban capital at the head of a huge delegation, estimated at somewhere between 800 and 1,200, that includes four state secretaries, dozens of congressmen, secret service agents, logistics staff and journalists. As well as the summit between the two leaders, top officials from the State, Commerce and Agriculture departments will hold bilateral talks on Monday. Many thorny issues remain unresolved. Cuba is adamant that no full rapprochement is possible unless the US lifts its embargo and returns the US navy base at Guantanamo Bay. Neither are acceptable to the Republic-controlled US Congress. Washington, meanwhile, is encouraging Havana to press forward with market reforms, improve human rights and allow the Cuban populace more say in decision making. The challenges in this area were apparent just hours before Obama arrived on Sunday, when dozens of pro-democracy protesters were arrested by police.",
President Obama Delivers Keynote Speech of His Cuba Visit,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/international/obama-in-cuba/video-keynote-speech-by-obama-in-cuba,03/22/16,www.nytimes.com,"When President Obama placed a wreath at the memorial to Jose Marti on Monday, the president paid his respects to the most Cuban of Cuban writers -- a journalist and poet whose ideals are invoked with heart-thumping zeal in both Miami and Havana. Hes that rare descendant whom both sides of a feuding family claim as their own. Or, as Achy Obejas, the Cuban-American novelist put it: ""Hes a little like the Bible: Whatever you want to find support for, theres usually a little something in his work that will reflect your desire."" ""Want some really gripping anti-imperialist words implicating the U.S. as a bully? Got it,"" she said. ""Want some poetry exalting individual freedom? Got it. A little anti-racism? No problem. Warnings about dictators? Here it is."" Among the old guard in Havana, Marti is best known for his searing criticism of an America obsessed with wealth and blind to inequality. Marti saw it firsthand. He lived ""in the monster, and I know its entrails,"" by which he apparently meant the United States. He lived in New York just about longer than anywhere else, and while he wrote admiringly about the American culture of ""utility"" -- ""this overwhelming and invincible, constant and frenetic drive to expand"" -- he also condemned the arrogance he saw and identified divisions still apparent today. Heres Marti writing about class warfare in Chicago in 1886: ""This republic in its excessive worship of wealth, has fallen, without any of the restraints of tradition, into the inequality, injustice and violence of the monarchies."" Here he is writing on Karl Marx and societal values in 1890: ""Rome prided itself on its generals: The United States prides itself on its rich men."" And yet, ultimately, Marti endures for Cubans and many non-Cubans because he focused on sovereignty, for both individuals and small nations fearing imperialism. Latin America, he wrote, has long been forced to worry ""about the disdain of the formidable neighbor who does not know her,"" and sovereignty has long been a Cuban obsession. And not just when Cubans look north. Marti died in 1895 fighting the Spanish for Cuban independence and he often worried about how his fellow soldiers would run the country if they won. He seemed quite aware that many would not live up to his ideals: ""To govern well, one must attend closely to the reality of the place that is governed,"" he warned. Just look at the memorial Mr. Obama is visiting. It was started under Fulgencio Batista, the inept, head-bashing dictator who fled ahead of Fidel Castros march into Havana. The site was a cash register of corruption -- when the design was chosen in 1943, The Times noted that ""criticism has been publicly and openly expressed"" on the exorbitant cost. The hulking memorial ended up a homely one, too: The Marti statue, nearly 60 feet tall, was designed to go with its angular tower reaching about 360 feet into the air. But then the memorial was appropriated as a backdrop for Fidel Castros communist government. Mr. Obamas arrival at the memorial will carry some symbolic weight. ""Standing in that space seems a gesture of both modesty and daring,"" said Ana Maria Dopico, a comparative literature professor at New York University. ""His visit to the monument honors a physical space that has been the anchor of the Plaza of the Revolution, a site of mass political life where Marti was often invoked to denounce American imperialism, aggression and embargo,"" Prof. Dopico said. ""But the wreath-laying is not merely official stagecraft to signal the end of a long stalemate. It allows for a kind of mind-blowing recoding, of monuments and leaders and national protagonists.""",
"In Cuba to make 'history,' Obama stands in the shadow of tyranny",https://nypost.com/2016/03/22/in-cuba-to-make-history-obama-stands-in-the-shadow-of-tyranny/,03/22/16,nypost.com,"President Obama inadvertently found the perfect photo op for his Cuba visit at a wreath-laying ceremony at the Jose Marti Memorial in Havana. A news photo at Revolution Square caught Obama standing together with American and Cuban officials with an enormous mural of the iconic revolutionary Che Guevara looming over his shoulder on the adjacent Ministry of the Interior building. Che, of course, is ubiquitous on dorm-room walls and T-shirts in the United States and a hero of the Cuban revolution. He also was a coldblooded killer who set up the Cuban gulag and presided over summary executions of political prisoners. (Trials were, per Che, ""an archaic bourgeois detail."") No doubt, he would have been astonished at the Yanqui president coming to Revolution Square to pay his respects -- and exceedingly pleased. Obamas trip is self-consciously historic. As the presidents introducer at an event at the US Embassy put it, Obama often said, ""Yes, we can,"" and now we can say, ""Yes, we did."" But did what? The trip ensures that the first visit to Cuba by an American president in almost 90 years will be part of Obamas legacy, and seeks to make his restoration of ties with Cuba, announced in December 2014, irreversible. If that means extending credibility and a financial lifeline to a Castro regime that has no intention of reforming, so be it. The regime made it clear that it wouldnt bother with maintaining a pretense of relaxing its grip with the arrest of protesters at a march of the dissident group Ladies in White while Obama was en route to the country. A reporter with a government news outlet told The New York Times that he and colleagues had been warned not even to discuss Obamas visit with friends. At a press conference with President Raul Castro on Monday, Obama spoke in euphemistic terms of our ""two different systems,"" eliding the fact that one system is open, democratic and prosperous, while the other is closed, dictatorial and economically ruinous. Castro railed against alleged human-rights abuses in the United States -- Obama obligingly said he welcomed the dialogue -- and El Presidente denied holding any political prisoners when reporters dared ask about it. There is no sign of greater openness in Cuba since President Obama forged his break with long-standing US policy. Political arrests have accelerated. There were more than 8,000 in 2015, four times as many as in 2010 or 2011. The exodus of desperate Cubans to the United States has picked up. And the country still ranks below Zimbabwe and Iran on Internet connectivity. But Obamas opening has produced a financial windfall for the regime. The Cuban military occupies the commanding heights of the economy and controls the tourism business, which has been thriving with the influx of American tourists. Starwood Hotels Resorts just got special permission from the US Treasury to operate two hotels in Havana, in a boost not for the free market, but for the Cuban government. If Cuba were a repressive, small-minded military dictatorship of the right, Obamas visit and accommodationist attitude wouldnt be considered so broad-minded. But a patina of revolutionary romance, embodied by that image of Che looking down on President Obama, still hangs over Cuba. It makes its human-rights abuses, theft and lies an after-thought, or even excusable, for the American left. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, Che said that in the event of a US attack, ""if the missiles had remained, we would have used them all and directed them against the very heart of the United States, including New York, in our defense against aggression."" It would have been beyond his imagining that so many decades later, with the revolutionary regime cash-strapped and decrepit, the imperialist Goliath would come bearing gifts, and asking for nothing substantial in return, except a line in Obamas Wikipedia entry.",
Obama presses Cuba's Castro on human rights during historic visit,http://www.firstpost.com/world/obama-presses-cubas-castro-on-human-rights-during-historic-visit-reuters-2689412.html,03/22/16,www.firstpost.com,"HAVANA U.S. President Barack Obama pushed Cuba to improve human rights during his historic visit to the Communist-led island on Monday, publicly sparring with President Raul Castro who showed flashes of anger and hit back at U.S HAVANA U.S. President Barack Obama pushed Cuba to improve human rights during his historic visit to the Communist-led island on Monday, publicly sparring with President Raul Castro who showed flashes of anger and hit back at U.S. ""double standards"". In a joint news conference that began with jokes but was tense at times, Obama praised Castro for openly discussing their differences but he said a ""full flowering"" of the relationship would happen only with progress on the issue of rights. ""In the absence of that, I think it will continue to be a very powerful irritant,"" Obama said after talks with Castro, in remarks broadcast live on Cuban state television. ""America believes in democracy. We believe that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion are not just American values but are universal values."" The Cuban leader countered that no country meets all international rights but appeared uncomfortable as he made the rare step of taking questions from journalists in a country where the media is state controlled. Obama, the first U.S. president to visit Cuba in 88 years, agreed in 2014 to improve relations with the former Cold War foe but he is under pressure at home to push Castro's government to allow political dissent and to further open its Soviet-style economy. Opponents say he has given away too much as he improves ties, with too little from Castro in return, although leading Republican candidate for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump, said on Monday he would likely continue to normalize ties with Cuba if elected. Castro, an army general who became president when his ailing older brother Fidel retired in 2008, had never before taken questions from foreign reporters on live Cuban television and was clearly irritated when asked about political prisoners in Cuba, demanding the reporter produce a list of those in jail. ""Tell me now. What political prisoners? Give me a name, or the names,"" Castro said. ""And if there are these political prisoners they will be free before nightfall."" Cuba says it has no political prisoners and that the dozens listed by dissident groups are instead common criminals. Castro said Cuba has a strong record on rights such as health, access to education and women's equality. His government criticizes the United States on racism, police violence and the use of torture at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Ben Rhodes, a senior aide to Obama, later insisted that Cuba has political prisoners and said the U.S. government had shared lists of them with Cuba. However, he said that such detentions were now for shorter periods than in the past. Obama's ease with reporters' questions contrasted with Castro's manner. With American flags hanging in Revolution Palace, the tension was palpable as Castro declined to call on a slew of Cuban journalists who yearned for the rare chance to ask him questions. ""EMBARGO'S GOING TO END"" Fumbling with a headset providing translation, the 84-year-old leader scolded reporters when he was asked again about rights, saying he agreed to only take one question. Obama playfully encouraged him to address a second but Castro seemed reluctant as he obliged. ""How many countries comply with all 61 human rights? Do you know? I do. None. None,"" Castro said. In another awkward moment, as the news conference ended, Castro lifted Obama's arm in the air as if to form a victory salute. Obama resisted, letting his hand hang limp rather than form a fist. As part of the diplomatic breakthrough in 2014, Cuba released 53 prisoners that the U.S. government considered political prisoners. But the dissident Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation says 79 are still behind bars, among them more than 40 held for peaceful political protest. ""This list is here if they want to see it,"" commission leader Elizardo Sanchez said on Monday. His commission's list also includes armed anti-government militants, convicted hijackers, army deserters and spies, but Sanchez said they are considered political because they were denied due process. Castro offered Cuba's recipe for better relations, saying the United States needs to lift its 54-year-old trade embargo on the island and hand back the Guantanamo Bay base to Cuba. Obama did not respond to the demand on Guantanamo Bay but said he was optimistic about the elimination of economic sanctions against Cuba. ""The embargos going to end. When, I cant be entirely sure,"" Obama said. Obama has urged Congress to rescind the economic embargo but has been rejected by the Republican leadership. Thwarted so far, Obama has instead used his executive authority to take a series of steps loosening restrictions on trade and travel. Obama said direct flights from the United States would start this year. He said regular tourism to Cuba could happen ""very soon,"" in comments to U.S. network ABC. A clutch of business deals timed to coincide with the visit appeared to show the strategy was bearing commercial fruit, notably U.S. cruise company Carnival's announcement on Monday that it would sail the first ship from the United States to Cuba in more than 50 years, in a deal that will bring in thousands of U.S. tourists at a time. About a dozen major U.S. brands have stuck deals or are in talks with Cuba. Ahead of the meeting with Castro, Obama said Google (GOOGL.O) would provide more Wi-Fi and broadband access on the island. Google said later its efforts were in the ""early stages.""

Story highlights President Obama urges end to embargo on Cuba He also presses for greater Internet access for Cubans CNN -- President Barack Obama called for the U.S. embargo against Cuba to be lifted and for Cubans themselves to embrace change in a historic address from Havana. ""Its time to lift the embargo,"" Obama told Cuban officials and dignitaries gathered at the Grad Teatro de la Havana Alicia Alonso, including President Raul Castro. ""But even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow, Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba."" Obamas landmark visit to Cuba follows the December 17, 2014, agreement to begin normalizing relations between the U.S. and Cuba after a more than a half century of estrangement. He is the first sitting president to visit Cuba since 1959. In remarks Tuesday, the President used his visit - unimaginable just a few years ago - his presidency and even the ongoing U.S. presidential campaign as examples of the benefits and opportunities available to Cuba as it embraces change. Even as terror attacks rattled Brussels and much of the West, Obama only briefly digressed from his prepared remarks to address the violence. The rest of his approximately 40-minute speech was devoted to pushing forward a new era with Cuba. ""I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas,"" he said to applause. ""I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people."" But Obama noted that there were still ""very real differences"" between the two countries, stretching from their political systems to their economic models, and made an extended appeal for greater freedoms on the Communist island. ""I cant force you to agree,"" he said, before outlining his belief that ""every person should be equal under the law"" and that ""citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear"" - a line that drew applause. He also said that people should be able ""to organize and to criticize their government and to protest peacefully,"" and that they should not be arrested for doing so. ""Not everyone agrees with me on this,"" Obama said, ""but I believe those human rights are universal. I believe they are the rights of the American people, the Cuban people and people around the world."" Obama told the crowd that democracy allows for the fullest expression of the ideals of any revolution - American, Cuban or otherwise, not because democracy is perfect, but because ""It gives individuals the capacity to be catalysts."" Pointing to Democratic presidential candidates, Obama noted the diverse array of candidates. ""You had two Cuban-Americans in the Republican Party running against the legacy of a black man who was president while arguing that theyre the best person to beat the Democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a democratic socialist,"" he said. ""Who would have believed that in 1959,"" Obama added, to the crowds laughter. ""Thats a measure of our progress as a country."" Obama also pointed to some specific changes the U.S. would like to see, including less red tape for Cubans who want to open businesses or work for foreign companies investing in Cuba, and greater Internet access. Even as Obama urged change, he pledged to Cubans that they had no reason to fear U.S. attempts to strong-arm them. ""Ive made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity or the intention to impose change on Cuba,"" Obama said. ""What changes come will depend on the Cuban people."" After his speech, the President met with a dozen Cuban dissidents and spoke of their ""extreme courage"" in a conversation that touched on their concerns about issues such as religious freedoms and freedom of the press. All the dissidents had been detained, some more recently than others. White House officials wouldnt comment on participants of the meeting but did react to reports that Cuban authorities were arresting dissidents in Havana in advance of it. ""We reiterate our call for the Cuban government to end the practice of arbitrary detentions,"" National Security spokesman Ned Price said. Obama returned to his call for greater Internet access in his address when he told his audience that sustainable economic growth and prosperity doesnt just require strong education systems, health care and environmental protections. ""It also depends on the free and open exchange of ideas,"" Obama said. ""If you cant access information online, if you cannot be exposed to different points of view, you will not reach your full potential, and over time, the youth will lose hope."" He acknowledged that the issues were sensitive coming from a U.S. president. ""Since 1959, weve been shadow boxers in this battle of geopolitical politics and personalities,"" Obama said. ""I know the history, but I refuse to be trapped by it.""",
Obama appeals for economic revolution in Cuba with call to embrace free market,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/obama-cuba-embargo-free-market-economy,03/22/16,www.theguardian.com,"Barack Obama urged Cuba to embrace the free market in a landmark speech in Havana that championed economic liberty rather than political reform as the key to unleashing the potential of its people. Ignoring calls to echo Ronald Reagans famous ""tear down this wall"" speech in Berlin, Obama drew another leaf from the cold war playbook and focused instead on the role of capitalism in transforming society from within. ""Many suggested that I came here to Cuba to tear something down, but I am appealing to the young people to lift something up,"" Obama told a handpicked audience of 1,000 in the Havana theatre that hosted the last US president to speak in the country, 88 years ago. Although calling for free elections and an end to the detention of dissidents, Obamas trip has focused heavily on the growth of small business in Cuba as a sign of internal momentum for change that can circumvent political stalemate. ""We have a clear example of what the Cuban people can build - its called Miami,"" he said in Tuesdays televised speech. ""Being self-employed is not about becoming more like America, its about being more like yourself. ""What changes come will depend on the Cuban people, we will not impose our political or economic system upon you. ... But having removed the shadow from our relationship, I must speak honestly about the things we believe,"" added Obama. The speech, watched by the Cuban president, Raul Castro, and many government officials as well as US-invited guests, was received politely, with most applause reserved for Obamas call on Congress to fully end the trade embargo. ""It is time to lift the embargo, but even if we lifted it tomorrow, Cubans would not realise their potential without more freedom to open a business."" That was a speech that will perpetuate the dictatorship ...[Obama] didnt mention the word 'opposition even once Alier Gonzalez, democracy activist A smiling Castro left the theatre to chants of ""Cuba! Cuba!"" from many in the audience, who gave him a longer and more coordinated ovation when he entered the theatre. The message will be seen as more palatable to the Cuban leadership than the full-throated attack on political repressions that some activists had hoped for. President Raul Castro gestures after Barack Obama delivered a speech at the Gran Teatro de la Habana on Tuesday. Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Watching the speech on a vintage television set at her home in Havana, pro-democracy activist Alier Gonzalez scoffed at the presidents description of a ""new era"" for Cuba. ""So we are in a new era with the same old dictator? Thats a total contradiction! ""That was a speech that will perpetuate the dictatorship. He didnt challenge them. He didnt mention the word 'opposition even once,"" she said. Gonzalez, whose husband, the dissident Antonio Rodiles, was detained at a peaceful protest on Sunday, said the tone of Obamas visit had been ""naive"". ""We need stronger action, not weak words,"" she said. But Obama stuck to the upbeat tone he has adopted throughout this controversial trip, insisting that long-term, irreversible changes are afoot that few politicians can get in the way of. ""I have come here to bury the last remnant of the cold war in the Americas,"" said Obama. ""To extend a hand of friendship. ""Our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration."" Obama appealed to the shared bonds of history and culture between the two countries, describing the US and Cuba as ""two brothers that have been estranged for many years"". ""We both live in a new world, colonized by Europeans. Cuba was in part built by slaves who were brought from Africa,"" he said. ""Like the United States, Cuba can trace her heritage to both slaves and slave owners."" Reflecting his attempts to reset relations with Latin America, he said called for a new sense of unity, breaking into Spanish to say: ""Todos somos americanos"" - we are all Americans. His use of that word will have particular resonance for Latin Americans who resent what they see as the US appropriation of a term which applies to all people of the Americas. He even accepted the validity of some of Castros attacks on Americas own civil rights problems and lack of guaranteed healthcare, also acknowledging local fears of a US corporate invasion once trade restrictions are finally lifted. ""Before 1959, some Americans saw Cuba as something to be exploited. I know the history but I refuse to be trapped by it,"" Obama said. Though desperately poor, many ordinary Cubans remain suspicious of US economic intent, especially in a country where there is no McDonalds, no Starbucks and no Coca-Cola. American credit cards do not work, and tourists hoping the US dollar is the preferred currency get a rude awakening when they are charged high fees to change them into pesos. Our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration Barack Obama ""There is one word that identifies our country since 1868 and that is independence,"" said the concierge at one of the luxury hotels frequented by Americans in old Havana. ""It is as simple as that. Maybe it will be a good thing that McDonalds doesnt open. It will be the first step towards our death,"" he said. Obama seems well aware of such sentiment, calibrating his speech to avoid causing offence and trying instead to inspire. ""Part of Cubas identity is in being a small island nation that can stand up for its rights and stand out in the world. [But] Cuba doesnt have to be defined as being against the United States."" After the speech, Obama and the secretary of state, John Kerry, met a group of dissidents, including Rodiles, at the US embassy, where he said that there are still ""deep differences"" with the Cuban government on issues of freedom and democracy. Praising the activists for their ""extraordinary courage"", Obama said: ""My hope is that by listening and hearing from them that we can continue to refine our policy in such a way that ultimately the Cuban people are able to live freely and prosperously."" Berta Soler, the leader of the Ladies in White - who consist of wives and relatives of former political prisoners - said most of the activists who participated were in favour of the visit and the rapprochement process. ""There was a diversity of opinion,"" she told the Guardian. Soler, who was arrested and beaten alongside Rodiles at Sundays protest, said that Obama should have raised the subject of arbitrary arrests with Castro. ""He should have been more forceful in condemning the repression and the violence against us,"" she said.Outside Obamas speech however, the US visit is, as far as the Cuban public is concerned, a virtually private affair, witnessed by the worlds media and the Cuban elite but not ordinary citizens of the capital. Because there is no internet in the city outside the luxury hotels and special ""Wi-Fi parks"", few in Havana seem to know much of Obamas schedule this morning other than that their city centre is in complete lockdown. An army of volunteers was operating a human barrier at a six-block radius from Parque Central, site of another symbolic speech on this three-day trip. It means nobody, apart from those who live in the old city, will get to see anything other than Obamas lengthy convoy speeding down the ocean-hugging boulevard, the Malecon.",
Historic U.S. cruise docks in Havana,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-cuba-cruise/index.html,05/02/16,www.cnn.com,"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Ana Garcia was crying and could hardly walk as she left the cruise ship that took her from Miami to Havana. It had been more than 48 years since she stepped foot in the country where she was born. ""I'm just thinking of that day when we left (Cuba) and shaking like a leaf,"" she said. Garcia is one of about 700 passengers on the first cruise in decades to travel from the United States to Cuba. The Adonia, a ship on Carnival Corp.'s Fathom cruise line, docked Monday in Havana. The ship's arrival marks the first stop on a historic, seven-day voyage that signals closer ties between the United States and its communist-run neighbor. As the ship arrived, crowds onboard started chanting, ""Cuba! Cuba! Cuba!"" For Garcia, the city manager of North Miami Beach, Florida, pulling into the port was an emotional experience. ""I'm blessed to be here today,"" she said, ""and hoping for a better tomorrow for Cuba and my Cuban brothers and sisters."" A warm welcome Large crowds waved to the boat from the shore as it approached Havana. Bands and dancers greeted passengers at the port. Cuban rum drinks awaited them as they made their way into Havana. The seven-day cruise is scheduled to stop in three cities: Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. Ship left protesters in its wake The boat set sail from Miami on Sunday as salsa music played and protesters picketed nearby. Standing beside Cuban and American flags, the cruise manager touted the journey as ""the beginning of a new era."" Not everyone was happy about the new route. A small group of protesters gathered outside the port Sunday. And as the cruise ship was getting ready to leave Miami, police descended upon a nearby boat labeled Democracia, where demonstrators held a blue sign that said, ""Castro why do you ask Cubans for a Visa to visit their own country?"" But passengers on the ship said they wanted to put politics aside. As the boat sailed, a salsa band serenaded passengers on deck. Jesse Mercado, a business owner from Los Angeles, was one of the first to hit the dance floor with his girlfriend, putting aside the small American and Cuban flags they had been waving at people on the shore as the ship passed by Miami's South Beach. He said he was looking forward to buying some of the island's famed cigars, but he most likely wouldn't try to bring them back to the United States, where an embargo on Cuban-made products still exists. ""I'll probably smoke them all there (in Cuba),"" he laughed. Gary Carlson said controversy surrounding the cruise doesn't add up. ""I'm not sure I really understand, because it's time to put those things behind us,"" he said. ""Really the big issue is government to government, not people to people, and that's what we're excited about participating in."" Cruise almost didn't happen The voyage, the first U.S. cruise bound for Cuba in nearly 40 years, almost didn't happen as scheduled. Last month, controversy erupted over a Cuban law that prevented Cuban-born passengers from coming to the island on boats. The law stopped Fathom owner Carnival Corp. from selling tickets to Cuban passengers. But the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit aren't on this week's voyage, according to lawyer Javier Lopez, ""not because they don't want to be, but because the Cuban government requires people that were born in Cuba to jump through a whole bunch of other hurdles."" Cruise officials said six of the passengers on the cruise are Cuban. Beatriz Melendez is one of them. The 52-year-old was 4 when she left Cuba with her sister and parents.

Emotional return as first U.S. cruise in decades reaches Cuba,http://www.firstpost.com/world/emotional-return-as-first-u-s-cruise-in-decades-reaches-cuba-reuters-2761110.html,05/03/16,www.firstpost.com,"HAVANA Hundreds of tourists and a handful of emotional Cuban-Americans arrived on the first U.S. cruise ship to sail to Havana in more than 50 years on Monday, spilling onto the cobbled streets of the old city where they were warmly greeted by residents. HAVANA Hundreds of tourists and a handful of emotional Cuban-Americans arrived on the first U.S. cruise ship to sail to Havana in more than 50 years on Monday, spilling onto the cobbled streets of the old city where they were warmly greeted by residents. It was another first for the two countries since U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced a historic rapprochement in December 2014, and comes weeks after Obama's visit to the Caribbean island. Carnival Corp's Adonia, a small ship carrying 700 passengers, slipped through the channel into Havana Bay in the morning under picture-perfect skies, then docked alongside the colonial quarter recently visited by Obama. The visitors fanned out on the city's restored streets for walking tours after an arrival ceremony featuring Salsa and Afro-Cuban music, and lots of rum cocktails. For Cuban-born Anna Garcia, the moment was far more than just a holiday. ""Im nervous and excited at the same time, I left Cuba 48 years ago, when I was six year old. So just imagine everything that Im feeling right now,"" said Garcia as she stepped off the boat and entered Cuban territory for the first time since childhood. A Cuban law prohibiting people born in Cuba from entering the Communist-ruled country by sea had almost delayed the cruise but was lifted by local authorities just over a week ago after protests. Obama has made the dramatic shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba a part of his legacy. The two countries reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago and have signed agreements on issues of common concern such as the environment, postal services and direct flights. Talks are ongoing over other issues that have kept the next-door neighbors apart, from the return of fugitives to reparations for embargo damages and the return of the Guantanamo Naval Base. Obama had urged the Republican-controlled Congress to lift the embargo and travel ban, but to no avail, resorting to his executive powers to punch holes in them instead. Both sides appear determined to make further progress on travel before Obama leaves office. ""Regularly scheduled cruises are the third leg of the land, sea and air efforts by the Obama administration to cement its policy changes, the goal is to make the initiatives big and loud so that they are harder to dislodge,"" said John Kavulich, president of the New York-based US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. Obama has loosened restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba, though they must still engage in educational and other people-to-people activities and are banned from the beach. Cruises to Cuba could generate $300 million in revenues to the companies and $88 million to Cuba in the 2016/17 season if all the companies that wish to sail are given the required approvals, Kavulich said. Carnival's bi-monthly one week cruises to Cuba from Miami cost at least $1,800 per person, excluding Cuban visas, taxes and other fees.

Trump invited former military veterans to speak during the event. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Story highlights Trump was speaking in a state with a heavy Cuban voting bloc Trump's prepared remarks did not call for the ""freeing of political prisoners"" Miami CNN -- Donald Trump said Friday that he would reverse the deal President Barack Obama struck to reopen diplomatic relations and re-establish some trade with Cuba unless the Cuban regime meets his demands to restore political freedoms and free political prisoners. While Trump has said the US should have struck a better deal with Cuba, his new position was an apparent shift from his past statements that he supported the reopening of diplomatic relations after more than 50 years. Trump - speaking in a state with a heavy Cuban voting bloc - characterized Obamas deal as ""one-sided"" and benefiting ""only the Castro regime."" ""But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done with executive order, which means the next president can reverse them. And that is what I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,"" Trump said Friday. ""Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of political prisoners,"" Trump said. Trumps prepared remarks did not call for the ""freeing of political prisoners,"" a hefty demand Trump apparently added on the fly. Cuba freed 53 political prisoners in January 2015 as part of its deal to reopen diplomatic relations with the United States. The two countries officially restored full diplomatic relations in July 2015, more than 50 years after the two countries cut diplomatic relations amid Cold War tensions. The US embargo on Cuba still remains officially in place, but Obama loosened a series of regulations to allow more US companies to sell their products in Cuba. Obama has also argued that the reopening would help make Cuba a freer society by helping open the country to the world. Asked in September 2015 about the opening with Cuba, Trump said, ""I think its fine."" ""I think its fine. But we should have made a better deal. The concept of opening with Cuba -- 50 years is enough -- the concept of opening with Cuba is fine. I think we should have made a stronger deal,"" he told The Daily Caller. Trump also said in March that he would consider opening a hotel in Cuba. ""Maybe it wont work out, but I will tell you, I think Cuba has a certain potential and I think its OK to bring Cuba into the fold,"" Trump told CNN.",

Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced a thaw in relations in December 2014. The two countries restored full diplomatic relations in July 2015. Since then, Washington and Havana have taken once-unthinkable steps to mend ties after more than half a century of enmity. Obama visited Cuba earlier this year and relaxed portions of the US embargo imposed since 1962. Flights have resumed and cruise ships can now sail from Miami to Havana. US companies like Airbnb and Netflix now operate in Cuba and hotel group Starwood, acquired last week by Marriott International, opened a Sheraton in Havana last June. READ MORE: Rolling Stones rock into Cuba and make history DeLaurentis is currently the Charge dAffaires at the US Embassy in Havana and previously worked in Bogota and at the United Nations. But his nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is likely to face stiff opposition in Congress, where Cuban-American lawmakers have sought to garner local support by opposing Obamas policies. Any senator could place an anonymous hold on the nomination. Several Republican lawmakers have opposed Democrat Obamas outreach to the Communist regime led by Castro. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American presidential contender in the Republican primary race who ultimately lost to Donald Trump, blasted Obamas nomination. ""A US ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial and closed regime,"" Rubio said in a statement.

Accusing the Obama administration of failing to confront Cuba over its repressive policies, Rubio said the US embassy in Havana's Twitter account ""seems more like a travel agency than an advocate for American values and interests"". Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State Department and foreign operations, on the other hand, argued for DeLaurentis confirmation. ""The Cuban people have their ambassador in Washington. The American people need their ambassador in Havana,"" Leahy said in a statement. Cubas top diplomat in Washington, Jose R Cabanas, was given the rank of ambassador last year.",

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) FILE - In this Aug. 10, 2016 file photo a Cuban and a U.S. flag hang on the windshield of a car in a garage in Havana, Cuba. Diplomats say the U.S. is expected to abstain, for the first time, from a U.N. resolution criticizing America's economic embargo against Cuba. Such a step would effectively pit the Obama administration, with the UN, against the Republican-led Congress, which supports the 55-year-old embargo despite the United States' resumption of full diplomatic relations with Cuba. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States abstained for the first time in 25 years Wednesday on a U.N. resolution condemning Americas economic embargo against Cuba, a measure it had always vehemently opposed. The U.S. was joined in abstaining by Israel, the only other country to vote against the embargo resolution in the General Assembly last year. When the vote -- 191-0 with two abstentions -- was shown on the electronic board, diplomats from the 193 U.N. member states burst into applause. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power announced the abstention just before the vote saying that the U.S. policy of isolation toward Cuba had ""isolated the United States, including here at the United Nations."" ""After 55-plus years of pursuing the path of isolation, we are choosing to take the path of engagement,"" she said. ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. decision to change its vote follows President Barack Obamas restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba and his support for lifting the embargo, which the Republican-led Congress is against. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Dec. 17, 2014, that they were restoring diplomatic ties, which were broken in 1961 after Fidel Castro took power and installed a communist government. On July 20 last year, diplomatic relations were restored and embassies of the two countries were reopened, but serious issues remain, especially the U.S. call for human rights on the Caribbean island and claims for expropriated property. The U.S. abstention in the General Assembly vote was certain to anger both Republican and Democratic opponents of lifting the 55-year-old embargo, but it reflects President Barack Obamas belief shortly before he leaves office that its time to move ahead in normalizing U.S.-Cuban ties. Indeed, there were immediate protests in the U.S. Congress. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez from New Jersey, the son of Cuban immigrants, tweeted that the U.S. decision not to defend the ""long-standing, bipartisan, human rights-based US law ... is shameful."" Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted that the act that imposed sanctions on Cuba ""isnt a 'failed policy ... (and) is the law of the United States, which should always be defended and upheld."" Cubas Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, the last speaker before the vote, said Cuba is ""grateful"" for Powers efforts and words and thanked her for the U.S. abstention. ""A change in vote by the United States is a promising signal,"" he said. ""We hope it will be reflected in reality."" Rodriguez said the embargo is still in force and being implemented by U.S. agencies, and while the executive measures taken by Obama were positive, they have ""very limited scope and effect."" ""Lifting the blockade is the key to be able to advance towards the normalization of relations with the United States,"" he said. ""The blockade is unjust, inhuman, immoral and illegal and should unilaterally and unconditionally cease."" ADVERTISEMENT General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding and unenforceable. But the 25-year-old exercise in which the world body has overwhelmingly voted to condemn the embargo does reflect world opinion and has given Cuba a global stage to demonstrate Americas isolation on its Cuba policy. Before the vote, more than 20 speakers from all over the world denounced the embargo and urged the U.S. Congress to quickly lift the ban on trade and financial dealings. The U.S. administration had considered abstaining in the vote last October, but concluded it could not do so because the resolution did not reflect what it considered to be the spirit of engagement between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Power made clear that the United States ""categorically"" rejects statements in Wednesdays resolution suggesting the embargo violated international law. She also said that abstaining ""does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government."" ""We do not,"" Power said. ""We are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people."" She cited Cubas detention of government critics, threats and intimidation of participants in peaceful marches and meetings, and severe restrictions on outside information. In Havana, Cuba organized a vote-watching party on the campus of the University of Havana, where students and government supporters followed the events on an hours-long special live state news broadcast projected onto a giant screen. The tone of the coverage was triumphant, calling the U.S. abstention a historic victory for Cuba but cautioning that it was meaningless without Congressional action. ""The blockade is still in force but this means that theres been a change in attitude at the highest levels of U.S. government and politics,"" said Raul Palmeiro, a 21-year-old law student and president of the universitys official Student Federation. In last years vote, the assembly approved a resolution condemning the commercial, economic and financial embargo against Cuba with the highest vote ever -- 191-2. Only Israel joined the United States in opposing that resolution. ___ Lee reported from Washington.

Cuba on alert to see what Trump has planned for America's closest enemy,https://theconversation.com/cuba-on-alert-to-see-what-trump-has-planned-for-americas-closest-enemy-69018,11/23/16,theconversation.com,"Since the election of Donald Trump as the 45th US president, many in Cuba are wondering: what next? What next for Cuban-American diplomatic relations, or the recently reopened embassies in Washington and Havana? For Cuban-American business and trade or the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base? And what about the 60 men remaining in Gitmo Detention Facility, 20 of whom have been cleared by Periodic Review Boards for release - what next for them? On January 22, 2009, Obama signed an executive order to close Gitmo within the year. Not the naval base - as some optimistic pundits suggested - but the detention facility. Obamas wishes have not been fulfilled - although he has overcome mighty opposition in vastly reducing the number of detainees and speeding up the clunky and faulty review boards. Early in the presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to enlarge Gitmo, and to fill it with ""some bad dudes"". More recently he has suggested that US citizens may be held and tried in Gitmo. Guantanamo, as I have described before, is at the heart of US-Cuba relations. Senator Marco Rubio, for example - a prominent Cuban-American opponent to Obama - campaigned for Trump in Florida and advocated undoing Obamas executive orders concerning Guantanamo. He continues to oppose the diplomatic thaw between the nations, arguing that it emboldens the Castro regime and provides nothing for the US. The vice president-elect Mike Pence made a solemn promise to Miami Republicans just before the election that he and Trump ""will reverse Barack Obamas executive order on Cuba"" and ""will support a continuation of the embargo until we see real political freedom in that nation once and for all"". Such pledges were evidently appealing - Trump received half the Cuban-American vote, a result that surprised many given his inflammatory declamations against Hispanics, in particular Mexicans. He also received last-minute support from veterans of the Bay of Pigs. Trump is now assembling a team that by every indication will contain staunch opponents of Obamas hopes to end the long cold war with Cuba. Cuba on the alert While leaders of nations around the world greeted Trumps victory with celebration, reservation or condemnation, Cuban president Raul Castro responded by initiating national military mobilisations. These Bastion Strategic Exercises, first introduced with Reagans election and then reintroduced in 2004 in response to George W Bushs Cuba policies, are intended to strengthen Cubas defence capacity against military threat from the US, and they involve multiple units of land, sea and air forces. EPA/Ernesto Mastrascusa Yet Trump is not going to invade Cuba - why would he? He will have enough on his plate managing domestic civil rights concerns and protests against his plans to increase the fossil fuel industry beyond its present dangerous levels of exploitation. The military exercises in Cuba are a political statement which tap into a long tradition of visible militarised defiance and of galvanising (or attempting to galvanise) national unity against a common aggressor. ""Bastion,"" wrote Castro in the state news organ Granma on November 16, ""is heir to the richest traditions of struggle [...] the guardian of the spirit of resistance, heroism and rebellion, from the Wars of Independence to the 21st century."" The message to Trump could not be clearer. If Rubio, Pence or Trump believe that ratcheting up the diplomatic pressure will lead to Cuban capitulation then they wilfully ignore this very long tradition that Raul Castro eulogises. Neither will their stance improve human rights in Cuba, an issue Trump has raised. If the heat is turned up, Castro will be less likely, for example, to open Cubas prison system to scrutiny by international agencies such as Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International. Similarly, the Cuban state has for decades suppressed internal opposition by claiming - often correctly - international conspiracies to sabotage the revolution. The diplomatic thaw of the past few years has mirrored - in some areas - an internal thaw of such restrictive state authority in Cuba. Trumps changing stance But who can predict what Trump will do? He demonstrated wild inconsistency throughout the campaign. In an interview of September 2015, he seemed to support Obamas initiatives, stating: ""50 years is enough - the concept of opening with Cuba is fine."" A year later, while still campaigning, Trump responded to the question ""Would you break off diplomatic relations though on day one?"" with the ambivalent answer, ""I would do whatever you have to do to get a strong agreement"" - and indicated that he would wait before appointing an ambassador in Havana. Currently, the embassy is run by interim charge daffaires, Jeffrey DeLaurentis. Yet Trump is a businessman - indeed Hillary Clintons legal team has already claimed that Trumps business associates have done business with Cuba, an allegation he refutes. Rather than attempting to isolate Cuba, he may see commercial opportunity and seek to open up trade with US businesses. But if Trump wanted to open up Cuba for US business, he would have to reverse his own plans to reverse Obamas plans. And hed have to use his own executive orders to bypass hostility from his own party in Congress. This all seems very unlikely. Yet- as weve seen - with Donald Trump, anything seems possible.",
Castro's legacy: how the revolutionary inspired and appalled the world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-legacy,11/26/16,www.theguardian.com,"No street bears his name and there is not a single statue in his honour but Fidel Castro did not want or need that type of recognition. From tip to tip, he made Cuba his living, breathing creation. Children in red neckerchiefs scampering to free schools, families rationing toilet paper in dilapidated houses, pensioners enjoying free medical treatment, newspapers filled with monotonous state propaganda: all in some way bear the stamp of one man. Historians will debate Castros legacy for decades to come but his revolutions accomplishments and failures are on open display in todays Cuba, which - even with the reforms of recent years - still bears the stamp of half a century of ""Fidelismo"". The ""maximum leader"" was a workaholic micro-manager who turned the Caribbean island into an economic, political and social laboratory that has simultaneously intrigued, appalled and inspired the world. ""When Fidel took power in 1959 few would have predicted that he would be able to so completely transform Cuban society, upend US priorities in Latin America and create a following of global proportions,"" said Dan Erikson, an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue thinktank and author of The Cuba Wars. The most apparent downside of his legacy is material scarcity. For ordinary Cubans things tend to be either in short supply, such as transport, housing and food, or prohibitively expensive, such as soap, books and clothes. These problems have persisted since Fidel handed the presidency to his brother Raul in 2008. Despite overtures to the United States and encouragement of micro businesses since then, the state still controls the lions share of the economy and pays an average monthly wage of less than PS15. This has forced many to hustle extra income however they can, including prostitution and low-level corruption. The lucky ones earn hard currency through tourism jobs or receive dollars from relatives in Florida. Cubans are canny improvisers and can live with dignity on a shoestring, but they yearn for conditions to ease. ""We want to buy good stuff, nice stuff, like you do in your countries,"" said Miguel, 20, gazing wistfully at Adidas runners on a store on Neptuno street. Castro blamed the hardship on the US embargo, a longstanding, vindictive stranglehold which cost the economy billions. However, most analysts and many Cubans say botched central planning and stifling controls were even more ruinous. ""They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work,"" goes the old joke. Thanks to universal and free education and healthcare, however, Cuba boasts first-world levels of literacy and life expectancy. The comandante made sure the state reached the poorest, a commitment denied to many slum-dwellers across Latin America. Idealism sparkles in places such as Havanas institute for the blind where Lisbet, a young doctor, works marathon shifts. ""We see every single one of the patients. Its our job and how we contribute to the revolution and humankind."" Castro continued to hold a place in peoples hearts and minds despite largely withdrawing from public life in the last decade of his life. Increasingly infirm, he mostly tended his garden in Zone Zero (the high security district of Havana), rebutted frequent premature rumours of his death with photographs showing him holding the latest edition of the state-run newspaper Granma, and wrote the occasional column, including grumpy criticism of Cubas drift towards market economics and reconciliation with the United States. Pope Francis meets Cubas Fidel Castro, as Castros wife Dalia Soto del Valle looks on, in Havana in 2015. Photograph: Alex Castro/AP But his influence was clearly on the wane. Although he met Pope Francis in 2015, he spent a lot more time with his plants than with national and global power brokers. Even before his death, he had become more of a historical than a political figure. ""Fidel was the dominant figure for decades, but Raul has been calling the shots,"" observed a European diplomat based in Havana, who predicted the death would have more symbolic than political significance. ""Has his presence been a block to reforms? Possibly. There could be an impact on young Cubans, but we wont see a huge shift of Cuban politics after Fidels death. More significant would be if Raul dies because he put his leadership on the line for reform."" Cuba had already begun the move away from Fidels era in a similar series of gradual steps to that taken in China after the the death of Mao Zedong or Vietnam after the demise of Ho Chi Minh. Under the Economic Modernisation Plan of 2010, the state shed 1m jobs, and opened opportunities for small private business, such as paladares - family-run restaurants - and casas particulares, or home hotels. Farmers have been given more autonomy and price incentives to produce more food. The government has eased overseas travel restrictions, loosened pay ceilings, ended controls on car sales and tied up with overseas partners to build a new free-trade zone at the former submarine base in Mariel. The biggest changes have been in the diplomatic sphere, where Cuba strengthened ties with the Vatican and signed a historic accord with the United States to ease half a century of cold war tension. But this is still an island shaped more by Fidel Castro than any other man. Wander up the marble steps at the centre of Revolution Square and stand where Castro used to give his marathon orations to an audience of more than a million and you can still see just how much the revolution he led reshaped the country. On one side are the giant profiles - illuminated at night - of his two lieutenants: Che Guevara on the ministry of the interior and Camilo Cienfuegos across the facade of the communications ministry. In the distance, you can see the tower blocks that were formerly the headquarters of major US corporations such as ITT and General Electric but were nationalised under Castro, and hotels such as the Havana Libre, which were once owned by US mobsters but later turned over to the state. Part of Cubas charm for tourists - and the curse for many locals - is that it is all too easy to remember what life here was like in the early days of the revolution because the city has barely move on in the subsequent half century. Thanks to the economic embargo imposed by the United States, Castros Cuba became a time capsule. Despite a partial facelift ahead of Pope Franciss visit in 2015, many streets are still lined by crumbling colonial facades and potted by holes that look like they have been there for decades. The former mafia hotels have had little more than a lick of paint since they were frequented by mobsters like Meyer Lansky and Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano. And, of course, classic cars from the 1950s - Buicks, Chryslers, Oldsmobiles and Chevrolets - still cruise the Malecon. Close to Revolution Square is the run-down La Timba neighbourhood, where a young Fidel Castro cut his teeth as a lawyer defending the local community of shanty-home dwellers against eviction by developers. Juvelio Chinea, an elderly resident, said the changes brought by the revolution in his own life had been modest, but his sons and grandsons had been able to attend university - the first generations in their family to be able to do so. Chinea recalls hearing the comandantes speeches from inside his home. The 21-gun salute used to crack the walls and shake the cutlery. There would be singing and shouting from the crowd, then a hush as Castro started speaking. ""Some speeches were better than others,"" he remembers. ""I wish he could have stayed in power longer."" Not everyone is so sure about that. At the law department in Havana University, where Castro studied from 1945, there is admiration for the countrys former leader, but many believe he held back development. ""The best thing Fidel did for Cuba was to give us free healthcare at the level of a first world nation,"" said one student. ""The worst thing is that economic change has been delayed. If Fidel and Raul had acted earlier, many of todays problems would already have been solved."" The student dreams of starting his own private law firm but that is not yet possible, he says, ""because the government prefers to keep lawyers and courts under control"" so he is thinking of joining his brother, who moved recently to the United States. Nonetheless, he is proud of his countrys and his universitys history. ""Its great that this school was where an icon like Fidel studied."" Members of the Cuban delegation wave flags beneath portraits of the South American libertor Simon Bolivar and the Cuban national hero Jose Marti at the World Social Forum in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2006. Photograph: Fernando Llano/AP That many still feel affection for ""El Jefe Maximo"" despite his ruinous economic policies is because he is judged more for his nationalist triumphs than his communist failures. Castros main inspiration was not Karl Marx, but Jose Marti, the 19th-century Cuban independence hero. While the latter fought to eject Spanish colonisers, Castro ended US neo-imperialist rule by kicking out US corporations and gangsters. The former banana republic is now proudly sovereign. Camilo Guevara, the son of Castros comrade-in-arms Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, said these achievements were secure despite the recent overtures from Washington. ""The revolutionaries changed the status quo and established a base for this nation that is independent, sovereign, progressive and economically sustainable. Thats how we got where we are,"" he said at the Che Guevara Institute, which is dedicated to maintaining the ideological legacy of his fathers generation. The message is driven home at the Museum of the Revolution, where the trophies of the early Castro era are prominently displayed outside the building that was once the presidential palace. Here you find the Granma yacht, on which Castro and 81 fellow revolutionaries sailed from Mexico in 1956 to begin the war against the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Here too is the engine of the US U-2 spy plane that was shot down in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis. Inside, the exhibits and photographs ram home how this small island, under Castros leadership, defied the Yankee superpower despite the threat of nuclear annihilation. For many elderly Cubans, that was a terrifying, thrilling time to be alive and they remain grateful to Castro for guiding them through it. Frank Lopez, a retired teacher, speaks fondly of that early era under the comandante. ""It was frightening. The US jets would fly low and fast above the city, shattering the windows with their noise. We were all trained to use rifles and machine guns and would have to do drills every night. But in the end, nothing happened and we all went back to school. People should stand up to the US more often."" But he is not dewy-eyed about Castro. Although he admires the early healthcare and education reforms, he also recalls the economic hardships and the intrusive, suspicious state security apparatus. At one point, he was placed under surveillance for six years because a friend had plotted against Castro. These days, a bigger problem is making ends meet in the face of shortages of basic foodstuffs. ""We must all do other work to get by. Its been like that for more than 20 years,"" he says. ""So while we say thank you to the revolution for the education and healthcare, we also ask how much longer we have to keep saying thank you."" While Castro became a figurehead for revolutionary armed struggle throughout and beyond Latin America, the former guerrilla was far from universally popular in his home country once he turned his hand to government. Property appropriations, restrictions on religion and crackdowns on suspected enemies left many, particularly in the old middle class, hating him - a sentiment that has spanned the generations. As a child, Antonio Rodiles said he rebelled after learning his mothers property had been confiscated and a cousin executed as a suspected CIA agent. ""They used to tell me 'Fidel is your daddy. I replied 'No, hes not. I hated them for forcing me to do things. As I grew up I realised this kind of system is not natural,"" he recalls. Today, he heads the opposition group Citizen Demand for Another Cuba and is often arrested and beaten. ""Fidel has left a shadow over Cuba. His legacy is terrible. He destroyed families, individuals and the structure of society."" Rosa Maria Paya. Photograph: Claudio Santana/AFP/Getty Images Similarly, Rosa Maria Paya grew up watching her father fight against and suffer from a system that tolerated little dissent. Oswaldo Paya was a leading campaigner for free elections who was imprisoned first for his religious beliefs and then for his political campaigns. He died in a car accident in 2014. Rosa Maria believes he was forced off the road by the government agents who were following him. She said the Castros have left a legacy of tyranny that is unchanged despite the cosmetic reforms and diplomatic deals of recent years. ""The Cuban people havent had a choice since the 1950s,"" she says. ""My father spent three years in a forced labour camp because he was Catholic. Others were imprisoned with him because they were homosexuals or dressed the 'wrong way. The reality is that you cant be alternative to the line of Fidel and Raul."" From the 1960s onwards, the Intelligence Directorate intrusively monitored opponents, many of whom were beaten by police or spent years in jail. Despite the release of dozens of political prisoners in the wake of the 2014 Cuba-US agreement, many activists were detained or harassed ahead of visits by Barack Obama in 2016 and Pope Francis the previous year. Yet, compared with the past, there is a little more scope for criticism, a lot more opportunity to travel, and slightly less of a sense of crisis. Cuba may still be more closely aligned to Venezuela than the United States, but it is clearly hedging its bets more than it used to do under Fidel. Today the country is different from the one that confidently erected a now-fading plaque on Avenida Salvador Allende with a quotation from Chiles socialist leader: ""To be young and not to be revolutionary is a contradiction, almost a biological one."" Instead, on Avenida G, a bohemian hub of cafes and street corners for Havanas teens, the talk is not of politics but iPods, fashion, films and Major League Baseball. In a valedictory speech at the close of the 2016 Cuban Communist party congress, Castro urged his compatriots to stick to their socialist ideals despite the warming of ties with the US, but he recognised that his generation was passing. ""Soon Ill be like all the others,"" he said of his dead comrades. ""The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban communists will remain as proof on this planet that if they are worked at with fervour and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need, and we need to fight without truce to obtain them."" Despite the trembling voice and mournful tone, it was a typically combative call to arms. The last of many. It may have been several years since Castros thunderous, marathon orations, but Cuba will still feel strangely quiet without him.",

Cuba's socialist icon and father of his country's revolution Fidel Castro died on November 25 aged 90, after defying the US during a half-century of ironclad rule and surviving the eclipse of global communism. Story highlights Fidel Castro was cremated and his ashes soon will be displayed in Revolution Square Havana quiet while celebrations spill out in Miami streets over news of Castro's death Havana, Cuba CNN -- The Cuban people will stop to pay their respects this week to the late Fidel Castro, the countrys former leader who dominated the island nation for decades. The national nine-day mourning period began Saturday, as the nation woke up to the news that the man who had long been the face of their nation was gone. ""The Cuban people are feeling sad because of the loss of our commander in chief Fidel Castro Ruz, and we wish him, wherever he is, that he is blessed, and us Cubans love him,"" a young Cuban woman told CNN, A sign that reads, ""Long live Fidel,"" stands on a Cuban government building early Saturday in Havana. Ramon Espinosa/AP Castro died Friday at 90. His brother, Raul Castro, announced his death in a televised statement. ""I say to the people of Cuba, with profound pain I come here to inform our people, our friends of America and the world, that today, 25 November, 2016, at 10:29 pm, died the chief commander of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz,"" Raul Castro said. All activities and public performances will stop, and the flag will be flown at half-staff in public and military establishments. Radio and television will broadcast patriotic and historical programming, state news outlet Granma reported. A concert by famed tenor Placido Domingo was canceled and clubs that were usually alive with music were silent. Granma reported the following time frame of events during the days of mourning: Cubans will be able to pay their respects throughout the country at different memorials on Monday and Tuesday. A public mass will be held in the Jose Marti Revolution Square in Havana on Tuesday evening. Fidel Castros body was cremated and on Wednesday, his ashes will be taken along the reverse route he took across the island after seizing power in 1959. The trek with Castros ashes finishes on Saturday and culminates with another mass in Plaza Antonio Maceo in Santiago de Cuba.

Cuban government-run website Cubadebate tweeted photos from the site: ""Because your people love you, they cry for you. Goodbye Comandante! #alwaystowardvictory #cuba #fidelcastro #untilforevercommandante Facebook photos from Cubadebate showed scores of young people at a gathering at the statue. Many held posters and some cried. In Biran, a town near Cubas eastern tip where Castro was born, people were calling and knocking on the door of his half-brother, Martin Castro. They wanted to know whether the hometown revolutionary was dead. ""They have been knocking and calling and asking if it is true,"" said Angel Daniel Castro, a nephew of Fidel Castros. ""Many people are crying. Some complain of high blood pressure. Fidel was a good man. ""For us, he was like a father. And Cuba sees him as a father. One woman just called crying and saying she had lost her father. Everyone feels it."" Jubilation in Miami The streets of Havana were as somber Saturday as the streets of Little Havana in Miami were festive Across the Straits of Florida in Miami. In the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, home to Cuban exiles, revelers partied all day, waving Cuban or US flags while some sang to festive music. Revelers spilled into the streets of Miami. They popped champagne, clanged pots, cheered and waved the Cuban flag in jubilation. They stood outside the popular Versailles restaurant in Little Havana with signs reading, ""Satan, Fidel is now yours.""

""Its a moment that weve been waiting for 55 years. Were free at last. The man that caused so much suffering, so much people to be sad in my country ... has passed away."" Castro reigned in Havana for nearly five decades with an iron hand, defying a US economic embargo intended to dislodge him. But he lived long enough to see a historic thaw between Cuba and the United States. The two nations reestablished diplomatic relations in July, and President Barack Obama visited the island this year. Obama extended ""a hand of friendship to the Cuban people"" as he offered his condolences to Castros family in a statement.

""History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him."" Fidel Castro dies: What now for US-Cuba relations? Historic figure of the 20th century To some, Castro became a romantic figure and a legendary survivor despite what Cuban officials say were more than 600 attempts to kill him. During a rare public appearance in April, Castro marveled that he had lived to his ninth decade. ""Soon I will turn 90 years old, never would such a thing have occurred to me, and its not the outcome of any effort; it was fates whim,"" Castro said, discussing his health, usually a taboo subject on the island. ""Soon I will be like everyone else. To all of us comes our turn."" Castro had many admirers, who saw him as a stalwart with his ubiquitous military fatigues and fiery oratory. He clung to a socialist economic model and one-party Communist rule, even after the Soviet Union disintegrated and most of the rest of the world concluded that state socialism was an idea whose time had come and gone.

A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr. Castro made significant improvements to the education and health care of his island nation."" 'End of an era for Cuba Other leaders noted Castros global impact but did not praise a man whose record on human rights was questionable. French President Francois Hollande said Castro ""embodied the Cuban revolution, with the hopes it aroused and then in the disillusion it provoked. Actor of the Cold War, he corresponded to an era which ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union."" Hollande also said he welcomed the recent thaw in US-Cuba relations. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he had had a ""lively discussion"" with Castro during a visit to Cuba in 2014. ""Under former President Castro, Cuba made advances in the fields of education, literacy and health. I hope Cuba will continue to advance on a path of reform and greater prosperity,"" Ban said. Pope Francis sent a telegram to Raul Castro expressing his sorrow for Castros family and the Cuban people, and offering his prayers. Dissidents repressed Many viewed Castro as an enemy of human rights, who suppressed and imprisoned dissidents. ""I am shedding tears tonight, but theyre tears of joy,"" said Armando Salguero, a Miami Herald columnist. ""Hell has a special place for Fidel Castro and theres one less vacancy in hell tonight."" He said many Cubans were cheering, because they had been forced to come to the United States when they couldnt have the freedom to make a life in their homeland. Repressive laws allow the government to jail and punish its critics, such as dissidents and journalists with long prison sentences, according to Human Rights Watch. The government also uses beatings and public acts of shaming, the organization reported. US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who fled Cuba with her family when she was 8 and went on to become the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, cautioned that ""the death of one dictator will not usher a new wave of change because the rulers of Cuba, whether its Fidel, Raul, whatever names you give them, they just rule over Cuba with an iron fist.""

""Ive been reading his sickening love letter to dead Fidel Castro and Im thinking, 'Sure, you did not lose a loved one to an execution squad. You did not lose a loved one to the gulags in Cuba, "" she said, while urging any foreign leaders praising Castro to look at the ""real record"" of his decades in charge. ""The only thing that Fidel has been successful in, has not been health nor education, or human rights or democracy, its been holding onto power - which is easy to do when you dont have elections,"" she said.",
Fidel Castro: mass rallies set for Havana and Santiago as ashes journey across Cuba,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/fidel-castros-ashes-to-be-buried-after-week-long-journey-across-cuba,11/27/16,www.theguardian.com,"Fidel Castros ashes will be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December, the Cuban government has announced. As the country began nine days of mourning, huge rallies have been planned in the capital Havana and in the eastern city of Santiago to honor the revolutionary leader. Alcohol sales were suspended, flags flew at half-mast and shows and concerts were cancelled after his younger brother and successor, Raul Castro, told the country late on Friday night that Fidel had died at 10:29pm. Large groups took to the streets on Saturday waving flags and chanting ""I am Fidel"" to salute Castro, who dominated the islands political life for generations. Newspapers were printed in black ink to mourn Castro, instead of the usual red of the official Communist Party daily Granma, and the blue of Juventud Rebelde (Rebel Youth), the paper of the Communist youth. There will be no top level games of baseball - Castros passion after politics - for the nine-day period of mourning, the sports national federation declared. Cubans will be able to pay homage to Castro at the Jose Marti memorial in Havana on 28 and 29 November, while a mass rally will be held in the capital on the evening of 29 November. The next day Castros ashes will begin their journey across Cuba, along the route that commemorates his victory in 1959. On 4 December, at 7am, his ashes will be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery - the resting place of 19th-century Cuban independence hero Jose Marti and numerous other leading figures in the countrys history. One large monument marks the grave of the Bacardi family, which founded a rum empire and dominated local politics in Santiago. Another building pays homage to the military officers and student martyrs who died during the war of independence against Spain in the late 19th century. There is also a veterans mausoleum for the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (Revolutionary Armed Forces). But the dominant feature is the monument to Marti, a marble building that houses a statue of the father of Cuban nationalism looking down over a wooden cask adorned with the Cuban flag. Several times each day there is a changing of the guard next to this historically charged spot. Three soldiers in ceremonial dress - with white gloves and yellow epaulettes - march in with exaggeratedly high kicks and arms swinging back and forth while the strains of the national anthem ring out from the public address system. Then, once they take their place, there is a moment of silence before the bell tolls to remind visitors of the sacrifices made to achieve sovereignty. Castro will be buried at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in southern Cuba. Photograph: Jonathan Watts/the Guardian There would be a nationalist logic in laying Castro beside Marti. While the latter led the 19th-century struggle against Spanish colonialism, the former took it a step further in the 20th century to rid the island of the shackles of US neo-imperialism. Recent renovations have suggested this is how the government is thinking. Workers are scrubbing gravestones, new marble has been laid and the main road from the airport and city centre has been upgraded. Cleaners say they have heard the rumours that Castro will be buried here but nobody has told them why they have been employed to buff up the tombstones. ""People in town talk about it, but nobody has said anything here. If it happens, it happens. I guess only our top leaders and the secret service know where he will be buried,"" said one elderly worker, whose hands are white from dust as he sands down a new row of marble gravestones. ""We started a year ago. Everyone says we have to do a nice job so we can leave this as a heritage site."" He points to a domed mausoleum nearby and says it is being built for Castro. ""They started it soon after they cleaned up the main avenue here from the city. It all ready, but it will be a terrible day when it is used. Everybody really loves Fidel."" But there are other spots in the cemetery where the revolutionary leader could be buried. A 100 by 15-metre area of grass between the Marti memorial and the monument to the revolutionary war dead would make a fitting resting place for a figure who led the guerrilla insurgency that made the island truly independent. It is bordered by red Matou Rojo flowers, which are said to represent the blood of those who gave their life for the country. Other areas of the graveyard are clearly less important. As in life, there is a hierarchy in death that places the tombs of the rich and powerful near the entrance, with the smaller gravestones of the middle class further in marked with just a marble angel or a stone tablet, and then at the far end several honeycomb-like 21 by nine blocks of simply scrawled names that sit close to the sewage drains. Famed for an austere lifestyle and dedication to equality, Castros socialist ideology might place him here, but locals believe he would need a more prestigious position in the cemetery not because of his individual views but because of his symbolism to the country. ""Its difficult for people to talk about, but there is gossip in the city,"" says a guide. ""The theory is that he will be buried close to Jose Marti because he took on so many of his ideas during his life,"" said the guide. The chatter intensified a couple of years ago when the authorities completely rebuilt the main roads from the city to the cemetery. As well as new asphalt, the central partition has newly planted flowers and neatly trimmed grass. It runs through the poor 7th January neighbourhood, where more than half a dozen brick houses have been repointed and repainted so their facades look new. It is clearly a cosmetic makeover rather than an upgrade to the entire community. Two blocks back - out of sight of the main road - nothing has been done to hide the crumbling, ramshackle exteriors. ""They came a year ago and did everything,"" said local resident Manuel Fui, whose home faces the road to the cemetery. ""They repaired the roof and painted the front blue. Nobody explained why."" However, he dismissed rumours that this was being done in preparation for Fidels funeral procession as idle gossip.",
Castro's legacy and the envy of many nations: social care in Cuba,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/27/castros-legacy-and-the-envy-of-many-nations-social-care-in-cuba,11/27/16,www.theguardian.com,"To his critics, the late Fidel Castro was a totalitarian despot, an opponent of free speech and a man determined to preserve his hard-won revolution whatever the cost. But to his defenders and admirers, he was a leader whose enlightened and practical approach to social care provided Cuba with enviable health and education systems. Figures from the UN childrens agency, Unicef, show that Cubas youth literacy rate stands at 100%, as does its adult literacy rate. In Mexico, youth literacy is around 98.5%, while adult literacy is at 93.5%. In the Dominican Republic, meanwhile, youth literacy is at 98.1% for females aged 15-24, 96.1% for males of the same age, and adult literacy is at 90%. Many of the educational gains were made in the early years of the revolution, not least during the 1961 literacy campaign that saw hundreds of thousands of Cubans, including schoolchildren, mobilising to educate their compatriots. The statistics, however, tend to mask todays commonplace shortages of housing, food and transport and the high costs of such basic items as books, soap and clothes. Perhaps even more vaunted are claims about the standard of Cubas healthcare. The islands reputation for medical excellence - a boon long enjoyed by allied governments and countries struck by natural disaster and medical emergencies - was most recently boosted by the deployment of Cuban medical staff to parts of west Africa during the Ebola crisis. In October 2014, 15,000 medical workers volunteered to participate in the relief effort. More than 450 specially trained Cuban doctors and nurses arrived in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone to combat the disease, making them the largest single national medical force. One doctor told Reuters at the time that he and his colleagues felt they had a responsibility to help: ""We know what can happen. We know were going to a hostile environment. But it is our duty. Thats how weve been educated."" The countrys high ratio of doctors to patients and its proactive, community-centred approach to healthcare has long been the envy of many western countries - not least the UK, which sent 100 GPs and a delegation from the Department of Health in 2000 to discover how it managed to deliver care on a far smaller budget. Despite serious shortages of food and drugs, the country has consistently managed to keep its population of 11 million people healthy into old age. Life expectancy in Cuba is 81 years for women and 77 for men. In the UK, it is 83 years and 79 respectively. And while the former spends $2,475 per capita on healthcare, the latter spends $3,337. Cuba dedicates 11.1% of its GDP to health; the UK 9.1%. Some, however, argue that the success of Cubas social care owes as much to politics and pragmatism as to equality and governmental magnanimity. As a senior western diplomat told the Guardian in 2007: ""Health and education are the revolutions pillars of legitimacy so the government has to make them work. If they dont, it loses all its moral authority.""",
"Cuba faces renewed tensions with U.S., but without Fidel Castro, its field marshal",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/cuba-faces-renewed-tensions-with-us-but-without-fidel-castro-its-field-marshal/2016/11/27/8b2498c6-b4bd-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html,11/27/16,www.washingtonpost.com,"The normally busy Infanta Street in Havana is quiet Sunday morning, as Cuba mourns Fidel Castro. (Lisette Poole/For The Washington Post) Fidel Castro once called George W. Bush a ""functional illiterate."" President Ronald Reagan was ""the worst terrorist in the history of mankind,"" Castro said, with ideas ""from the Buffalo Bill era."" Castro thrived on confrontation with U.S. leaders, and he almost surely would have enjoyed facing off against Americas next one. In his statement Saturday on Castros death, President-elect Donald Trump denounced him as ""a brutal dictator,"" and thats the sort of dig that wouldnt have gone unanswered in the past. But brinkmanship and barb-throwing are not the forte of his successor, Raul Castro, who replaced his elder sibling as president a decade ago. Raul Castro, 85, has refrained from criticizing Trump and even sent congratulations after his win. Raul Castros plans to secure the legacy of his brothers 1959 Cuban Revolution appear to be on a collision course with the incoming Trump administration, whose top members said Sunday that Cuba would have to make significant ""changes"" in order for the normalization path charted by President Obama to continue. Both Castros have long insisted they would never kneel to American pressure. If tensions between Cuba and the United States ratchet up again under a Trump presidency, it would be a new stress test for Raul Castro and his quieter, more austere leadership style. Cuba will enter the Trump era with Fidel Castros one-party socialist state firmly in command but without the supercharged politics and nationalist fervor he relied on to sustain it. The Washington Post's Karen DeYoung explains Fidel Castro's legacy in Cuba, and how it will affect the country politically. (Peter Stevenson,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) A return to more hostile relations with the United States could also bring a new crackdown in Cuba and further slow the pace of Raul Castros modest liberalization measures at a time of stalling economic growth. Hard-liners in Cubas Communist Party would gladly take the country back to a simpler time, when the antagonism of the United States -- not the failure of government policies -- was to blame for the islands problems, and the threat of attack, real or imagined, was used to justify authoritarian political control. In a possible warning shot, Trump tweeted Monday that he could revisit the landmark pact cut by the Obama administration to end the diplomatic estrangement with Cuba. ""If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,"" Trump wrote, without offering specifics on his concerns. On Fox News Sunday, Reince Priebus, Trumps incoming chief of staff, said, ""Theres going to have to be some movement from Cuba in order to have a relationship with the United States."" Castro would have to take steps to allow more political, economic and religious freedoms, Priebus said. ""These things need to change in order to have open and free relationships, and thats what President-elect Trump believes."" Obama announced in December 2014 that the United States would reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were severed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1961. Obama said that engagement with Cuba, including fewer restrictions on U.S. travel and trade, would facilitate the type of long-term democratic changes Washington had failed to bring about during a half-century of punitive sanctions. [Facing new test, Cubas revolution circles back] But Trump said during his campaign that Obama didnt get a good ""deal"" and that Cuba must do more. While only the U.S. Congress can lift the Cuba embargo, Trump could reverse many of the executive orders that have brought a surge of U.S. visitors here and a rush of new interest from U.S. companies. If Trump moves to roll back those measures and attempts to apply more economic pressure, the Castro government could dig in. During the last major peak in U.S.-Cuba tensions in March 2003, when Fidel Castro was still in charge, he ordered the roundup of 75 dissidents, sentencing them to harsh prison terms. A few weeks later, Castro crushed a spate of boat and airplane hijackings by Cubans trying to get to the United States, executing three men who commandeered a Havana passenger ferry and tried to steer it to Florida. But Cuba was a tighter-run ship then, where few dared to criticize the government in public. The governments security services are still pervasive, allowing no organized opposition, but the constant marching and mass rallies of Fidel Castros Cuba have mostly disappeared under the rule of his younger brother. Also, the governments monopoly on information has been broken. Millions of Cubans have cellphones, and more than 100 new WiFi hotspots across the island allow Cubans to go online and chat with friends and relatives abroad. Foreign television shows and news programming circulate widely on portable memory sticks. Fidel Castros soaring rhetoric is no longer the soundtrack of Cuban public life. Raul Castro delivers a speech every few months, choosing his words carefully and reading from a prepared text. A lifelong military man, he praises planning, modesty and preparation, and uses the word ""improvisation"" as a pejorative. Those qualities helped facilitate the secret negotiations with the Obama administration on restoring relations, but they may not help him counter more aggressive language from President Trump. Raul Castro doesnt tweet, doesnt give media interviews and shows no enthusiasm, unlike Fidel, for being in the spotlight. He could have a hard time leading younger Cubans back into the trenches of his older brothers ""anti-imperialism"" with calls for more sacrifice and obedience. [Cubans worry about what comes next after Fidel Castros death] Then again, Cuban national pride remains a powerful force on the island, and nothing stirs it like a perceived threat from a swaggering American leader, said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former Cuban intelligence analyst who teaches at the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley. ""Even if there is no Fidel, do not underestimate the power of mobilization of Cuban nationalism,"" Lopez-Levy said. Intense Cuban nationalism ""preceded Fidel,"" he said, ""and it will survive as a major actor in Cuban politics well beyond his passing."" At a small snack bar called ""Los Afortunados"" (""the Lucky Ones"") a group of young Cubans said Sunday that they feared Trump would take U.S.-Cuba relations into the past just as it seemed as though their lives were getting easier. If he restricted travel and the ability of Cubans in the United States to visit their relatives, ""it would be terrible for our families,"" said Yosbel Benitez, 30. His friend Ricardo Marrero, 28, who emigrated to the United States in 2013, was back for a visit. Marrero hadnt seen his wife and 4-year-old daughter in a year. But with the WiFi hotspots, he now sees them every day using the popular video chat app IMO. Two years earlier, it would have cost him $2 a minute to talk to them on the phone. ""Its what gives me the strength to keep working hard to bring them over,"" Marrero said. Air travel is easier, too. On Monday the first commercial flight from Miami in 50 years will land in Havana, and fares are less than half the price they are on the restrictive charter flights that have been the only option until now. Marrero wasnt eligible to vote in Florida, but he said he liked Trump and told his friends and family members not to fear the president-elects plans for Cuba. ""Hes a businessman,"" he said. ""He understands."" The snack bar, one of the types of privately run businesses permitted under Raul Castro, is directly across from the U.S. diplomatic compound, which Obama restored to full embassy status last year. Canada, Mexico and other nations had lowered the flags Sunday at their embassies in Havana in tribute to Fidel Castro, but the U.S. flag was snapping in the wind at the top of the pole.

Reuters Fidel Castro's ashes were being interred in a private ceremony Sunday morning, ending nine days of mourning for the man who ruled Cuba for nearly half a century. The military vehicle bearing his remains in a flag-draped cedar coffin left the Plaza of the Revolution in the eastern city of Santiago at 6:39 a.m. ET. Thousands of people lined the two-mile route to Santa Ifigenia cemetery, waving Cuban flags and shouting ""Long live Fidel!"" The Cuban military fired a 21-gun salute and crowds at the entrance to the cemetery sang the national anthem as the ashes entered about 40 minutes later. The ceremony lasted more than an hour and took place out of the public eye after Cuban officials made a last-minute cancellation of plans to broadcast the events live on national and international television. International media were also barred from the ceremony.

Fellow mourner Elena Vinales said she wasn't surprised that the images of the ceremony were not broadcast. ""It seems to be a family moment,"" she said. The decision to hold a private ceremony came the morning after Castro's brother, President Raul Castro, announced that Cuba would prohibit the naming of streets and monuments after the former leader, and bar the construction of statues of the former leader and revolutionary icon, in keeping with his desire to avoid a cult of personality.",
Cuba puts on show of strength as Trump inauguration nears,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba-march-idUSKBN14M0S2,01/02/17,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba paraded troops and hundreds of thousands of citizens through its emblematic Revolution Square on Monday in a traditional show of nationalist fighting spirit in the face of steep economic and diplomatic challenges. The event marked the 60th anniversary of the landing of the Granma yacht which brought the Castro brothers and their bearded rebels from Mexico to Cuba to start their revolution against a U.S.-backed dictatorship. Troops wielding automatic rifles marched in lock step behind a replica of the Granma on Monday, followed by a sea of banner- and flag-waving Cubans, many bussed in and organized through their workplaces and neighborhoods. ""This is an important message of unity and strength,"" said Rene Lazo, 66, who, like most, got up well before the crack of dawn to participate in the parade. ""This is going to be a difficult year but we will keep working hard to bring our people forwards"". Communist-ruled Cuba fell into an economic recession in the second half of last year, its first since the collapse of the Soviet Union a quarter century ago, as its strategic ally Venezuela floundered. Meanwhile its historic detente with the United States came under threat with the election of Donald Trump as President. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he would unravel attempts to normalize relations unless he gets a ""better deal"". Slideshow ( 10 images ) All this is taking place as Cuba is also coming to terms with the loss of its revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro. While ""El Comandante"" had handed the presidency over to his younger brother Raul in 2008, he remained a key figurehead. Some of those marching held up images of Castro or banners reading ""We are Fidel"". While the parade normally takes place every five years on Dec. 2, it was postponed a month due to his death in late November. ""He may not be present physically but he is in all our hearts,"" said Natalia Gonzales, who had painted ""I am Fidel"" on the foreheads of her three grandchildren. Raul Castro and his family watched and waved at those marching from the foot of the towering monument to independence hero Jose Marti in the center of the square. The mood on Monday was of defiance although many Cubans said they hoped there would not be a return of Cold War-era politics. ""We are braced for conflict with the USA, we always have been,"" said 70-year-old Marcial Garcia. ""But I hope Trump will instead follow the path ... towards normalization."" Trumps threat to gradual and still fragile detente could not come at a worse time for Cuba. A tourism boom in part sparked by looser travel restrictions on Americans failed last year to offset dwindling oil shipments from Venezuela and less cash for Cuban doctors and other professionals working overseas. ""Everything is just very uncertain at the moment, so theres more propaganda,"" said Antonio Sosa, 50, an engineer who chose not to attend the parade. ""You dont see news on the news broadcast anymore, just speeches Fidel gave 30 years ago.""",
"Ahead of Trump Presidency, Cuba Flexes Military, Political Muscle",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ahead-trump-presidency-cuba-flexes-military-political-muscle-n702401,01/02/17,www.nbcnews.com,"HAVANA, Cuba - Eighteen days before Donald Trump is to be sworn in as U.S. president, Cuba held a military parade and a ""fighting people's march"" in their nation's capital. The events took place on Monday morning at the capital's Plaza de la Revolucion ""on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Granma expedition's landing and the heroic uprising in Santiago de Cuba,"" according to the government's statement, marking the start of the Cuban revolution six decades earlier. The military parade was headed by Cuban children from elementary schools and it was made up of just troops without military assets. The march was led by blocs of Cuban young people, for whom the political and military event was to whom the official Cuban newspaper Granma was ""also dedicated."" Originally the military parade and peoples march was scheduled for December 2nd, 2016, but because of Fidel Castros passing it was postponed to January 2nd.

RELATED: Two Years After U.S.-Cuba Opening, What's Next Under Trump This is the second time since Trump was elected that the Cuban government flexes its military muscle; in November the Cuban Army carried out strategic exercises ""to consolidate the concept of War by the Entire People"" and to ""strengthen the homeland's military invulnerability"", according to President Raul Castro.",
Airlines Forced to Cut Trips to Cuba Because Americans Don't Want to Go,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/02/20/airlines-forced-cut-trips-cuba-americans-dont-want-go/,02/21/17,www.breitbart.com,"President Barack Obamas concessions to Cuba opened the way for U.S. airlines to do business with the communist dictatorship. After announcing frequent flights to the island over a year ago, however, many major airlines have found the demand they expected from U.S. tourists simply is not there. In an extensive report Friday, Bloomberg noted a general dismay both among airlines and other tourism-related businesses that Cuba was not proving as popular as they expected. The outlet reports that American Airlines was forced to cut a fourth of its flights to Cuba. JetBlue chose to use smaller planes rather than limit the number of flights but nonetheless had to address the low demand. Different experts offered different explanations for this situation. One noted that the popularity of Cuba trips did increase in the immediate aftermath of President Obamas 2014 announcement of restoring diplomatic ties with the dictatorship but that the initial interest ultimately fizzled. The soaring prices following the U.S.s entry into the Cuban tourism market did not help. According to Bloomberg, ""some rooms now cost as much as $650 per night, serving as a major deterrent to Americans hunting for novel warm-weather destinations,"" and those prices began to rise long before the airlines began flying south. While the United States relaxed laws allowing big businesses to operate in Cuba, the Cuban government did not change any of its laws to accommodate the extensive freedoms Americans are used to on free soil. This may have also impacted both Americans interest in Cuba and the ability of U.S. businesses to operate there. A major example of businesss profit hopes clashing with draconian Communist laws occurred last year when Carnival Cruises announced its first voyages to Cuba. Cuban-Americans looking to take advantage of the trips rapidly found they were not welcome because the arrival of Cuban-Americans by ship violated a Communist Party law passed after President John F. Kennedy chose to doom the Cuban Bay of Pigs invasion to failure. Carnivals decision to abide by Cuban law put the corporation at odds with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and triggered a wave of protests and a lawsuit. The Cuban government ultimately made an exception for Carnival. Similar legal minefields exist with other U.S. tourist enterprises. Tourism to Cuba is particularly dangerous for Cuban-Americans, as Cuban law does not recognize their U.S. citizenship, even if they were born in the United States and have never been on the island. The U.S. embassy in Havana was forced to release a warning to U.S. citizens with Cuban heritage that the government could arbitrarily seize their passports and arrest them for ""counterrevolutionary activities,"" not necessarily in response to any particular political activity. Tourists who do not have a Cuban background have another reason to stay away: Decades of communism have turned Cuba into an impoverished nation with limited luxuries and especially limited freedom of expression. Tourists who have written of their experiences there describe it as inconvenient and sad. ""I also saw up close an undercurrent of sadness I couldnt quite shake,"" wrote Kari Paul in Market Watch after her return. ""The oppressive atmosphere was impossible to ignore when I offhandedly told people I met to visit me in New York sometime, and watched them shake their heads."" Paul noted that she could not enthusiastically endorse Americans visiting the island, not just because of the sadness of the experience, but the knowledge that ""the influx of tourists is causing major food shortages for locals."" The website iAfrica found international tourists appalled at the conditions in Cuban hotels and restaurants. ""You spent three hours waiting to eat. Since they were state restaurants, the staff could have cared less,"" French tourist Jean Orsini protested. Other tourists noted that the four-star hotels often lacked running water.",
U.S. senators say Cuba's Castro keen to continue detente,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-idUSKBN1612O5,02/22/17,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban President Raul Castro made it clear to a visiting U.S. congressional delegation that his country was intent on pursuing market reform and detente with the United States, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy told a news conference on Wednesday. Slideshow ( 4 images ) Leahy, a Democrat who has been key in efforts to normalize relations, was leading a bipartisan group of five U.S. senators and a representative on a three-day visit to the Communist-run island to discuss ties and explore business opportunities. Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile U.S. detente with Cuba will fare under Republican President Donald Trump, who has threatened to backtrack on it if he does not get ""a better deal."" Analysts say Cuba has played its cards well so far by not responding shrilly to such provocation and demonstrating its continued willingness to engage under the new president. Castro ""wants reform to continue, he wants the movement forwards to continue,"" said Leahy at the news conference in the U.S. embassy, after meeting with the Cuban president on Tuesday. ""The number of people he had from his administration talk to us made it very clear they want us to continue."" The delegation met with Cubas foreign, trade and agriculture ministers as well as with Castro. The group included Republican Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi who on Monday oversaw the signing of agreements between Cuba and two Mississippi ports. ""Increasingly this issue of normalizing relations with Cuba is bipartisan, this isnt just Democrats, there are a lot of Republicans that believe we ought to do this as well,"" said Representative James McGovern, a Democrat. Support for the detente was also growing among the business and academic communities, said McGovern, who was traveling with a group of U.S. biotech experts keen to explore the sector in Cuba. ""The movement is more significant in the U.S.A. today than at any time in my career in the Senate,"" said Leahy. ""And I am the dean of the Senate, I have been there the longest,"" added Leahy, who was first elected to the Senate in 1974. The White House said earlier this month that the Trump administration was in the midst of ""a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba."" The visit came as a diplomatic incident highlighted continuing concerns about restrictions on human rights on the island. Cuban authorities prevented the head of the Organization of American States (OAS), a former Chilean minister and an ex-president of Mexico from traveling to Cuba to attend an award ceremony on Wednesday hosted by dissidents. Cuba opposes anything that legitimizes dissidents, who it claims are mercenaries funded by foreign interests. It also views the OAS as an imperialist instrument of the United States. OAS chief Luis Almagro reported that Cuban authorities said they were ""astonished"" at his involvement in ""anti-Cuban activities"" which were ""an unacceptable provocation."" A U.S. embassy official attended the ceremony, organized by the Latin American Network of Youth for Democracy, a group opposed to the Communist government. Almagros seat was left empty in symbolic protest. ""It may not be the smoothest of paths but it will continue,"" Leahy said of the U.S.-Cuban detente. ""I would not be here today on one more trip if I didnt think that continuation of that progress is inevitable.""",
"As further US airlines exit Cuba, what does the future hold for US-Cuba relations?",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/as-further-us-airlines-exit-cuba-what-does-the-future-hold-for-us-cuba-relations.html,03/16/17,www.cnbc.com,"Cuban and US flags are seen on balconies in Havana Yamil Lage | AFP | Getty Images U.S. airlines Silver Airways and Frontier Airlines have become the latest to bow out of Cuba due to weakened demand, posing new questions about the U.S's future relationship with its former Cold War foe. For a brief period under President Barack Obama, longstanding tensions appeared to be easing. But now, as the White House conducts a ""full review"" of U.S.-Cuba policies, diplomatic relations between the two neighbors look as uncertain as ever. Indications so far suggest that President Donald Trump would be loath to continue the detente initiated by his predecessor, which sought to loosen travel restrictions and barriers to trade implemented more than 50 years earlier. During campaigning, the now President tweeted his condemnation of human rights abuses conducted by Cuba's totalitarian government. Then, last week, Cuba's President Raul Castro made his first public retort, describing President Trump's policies as ""egotistical"" and ""irrational"". However, President Trump also has a pro-business agenda to ally. A number of U.S. companies took advantage of Obama's executive order and efforts to restrict business freedoms will not come easily. Indeed, it would not go unnoticed that Trump built his fortune on the tourism industry and his organization reportedly once sought to pursue possible business interests on the island. So where does President Trump go from here - and how should business respond? President Donald Trump Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images What are companies currently doing? Airline carriers Delta, jetBlue and American Airlines were some of the first to capitalise on Obama's policies. In the first year after restrictions were lifted, travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens grew 77 percent. However, a recent surplus of carriers and weakening demand have caused some national airlines to reduce services, while regional carriers Frontier Airlines and Silver Airways are to suspend their Cuba services entirely. ""Lack of demand coupled with overcapacity by the larger airlines has made the Cuban routes unprofitable for all carriers. As a result, Silver has made the difficult but necessary decision to suspend its Cuba service effective April 22, 2017. It is not in the best interest of Silver and its team members to behave in the same irrational manner as other airlines,"" Silver Airways said in a press note. Trade association Airlines for America told CNBC it is currently ""working with government"" to secure an adequate framework between the two destinations. Meanwhile, delivery services company FedEx announced this month that it is delaying the implementation of its regularly scheduled cargo service to Cuba by six months to address ""operational challenges in the Cuban market."" These challenges are also acutely felt by entrepreneurial start-ups on the island. Chad Olin, president of U.S. Tour operator Cuba Candela, set up his business to facilitate U.S. tourists under President Obama's normalisation programme. He now faces an uncertain wait under the White House's policy review. ""Although the new U.S. administration has introduced some uncertainty to the continued improvement of U.S.-Cuba relations, we are cautiously optimistic that relaxed travel rules will not be repealed,"" Olin told CNBC. John Kavulich, president of the U.S-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, regularly deals with businesses and policy makers with interests in the U.S. and Cuba and indicated that more still are in a state of limbo. ""U.S. companies are hesitant to re-engage or engage due to the uncertainty about what the Trump administration will or will not do with respect to Cuba,"" he explained, adding indications that the White House may intend to rescind certain freedoms. People take to the streets of Florida with Cuban flags Joe Raedle | Getty Images Potential hurdles If it is the case, however, that the new administration wishes to repeal President Obama's executive order, it won't be without litigation issues from current business license holders, noted Kavulich. A more likely scenario, at least in the short term, would be a partial freeze on issuance while the U.S. confirms its position, he said, noting conversations heard within government and the business community. ""There is not a desire to issue further (business) licenses, but also an acknowledgement that some license applications are and will be legitimate,"" he said. Christopher Sabatini, lecturer of international relations and policy at Columbia University, agreed that full reinstatement of the trade embargo would be unpopular, particularly in Florida, a crucial swing state which helped secure President Trump's election. ""Some of the entrepreneurial concession will be hard to roll back because people's lives rely on them,"" Sabatini told CNBC, referring to Florida businesses which export to Cuba. Such moves would make the President very unpopular, he said: ""You would see protests on the streets if they were removed."" ""Big ticket"" items, such as large corporates, would be easier to remove, Sabatini suggested. The exterior view of the south side of the White House Alex Wong | Getty Images Political contention As well as on the streets, Florida is likely to have an influential role in policy at a Congressional level, too. Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator for Florida, is one of six hard-line Cuban American members of Congress who believe President Castro's government is deeply untrustworthy and are likely to push for a retightening of policy. ""This (Cuban sanctions) is a concession President Trump can make to a very powerful constituency in Congress,"" said Sabatini, who remarked that the President may be keen to maintain his perceived favourability among Floridians. Last month, President Trump met with Senator Rubio and told a press conference of their ""very similar views on Cuba."" Such a concession may also be necessary given the complexity of the issue, notes Sebastian Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. ""President Trump will delegate his Cuba policy to others he trusts and he assumes understand the issue better."" ""That means people like Senator Rubio or Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart will be quite influential in defining the new policy. ""We don't know yet what such policy will look like, but based on the few signals from the Trump administration, it will be less congenial than Mr Obama's,"" Arcos noted. Justin Solomon | CNBC",
Trump may chill US-Cuba relations,https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/30/politics/trump-cuba-policy/index.html,05/31/17,www.cnn.com,"Story highlights Officials: Trump may reverse Obama-era policies softening relations with Cuba Gesture would fulfill campaign promises to Cuban-American voters and anti-Castro Congress members Havana, Cuba CNN -- President Donald Trump is expected to roll back portions of the Obama opening with Cuba as early as June, according to a US government official involved in the review of current US policy toward the communist-run island. That official, as well as other current and former administration officials and Cuba experts, expect an announcement from Trump soon that the United States would no longer make unilateral concessions to Cuba - as critics accused the Obama administration of doing. They also expect that Trump will demand US fugitives of justice, such as Assata Shakur, who received political asylum on the island after being convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper and escaping from a US prison, be extradited. And they believe the President will bar American companies from making deals with the Cuban military, which controls much of the state-run tourism industry. Trump is not expected to reverse all of Obamas changes, which were seen as the most significant relaxation of tensions between the United States and Cuba since Fidel Castros 1959 revolution. But, current and former US officials say, Trump is looking to make a symbolic gesture that will fulfill his campaign promises to conservative Cuban-American voters and anti-Castro members of Congress without closing the door on Cubas emerging market for US businesses. Video Ad Feedback 02:50 - Source: CNN Policy change allows US-Cuba boxing matches ""Im 1,000 percent sure the President is going to deliver on his commitment,"" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. R-Florida, who has lobbied the White House to reverse the Obama policy, told the National Journal in May. ""I have no doubt that youre going to see in short order a different policy."" Cuban officials have refrained from direct comment. A White House official who did not want to be named said the administration is still considering what precise actions to take against Havana. ""All of the suggestions in this article and more are on the table but none has been presented as yet to the President as of last night, but they are consistent with what he has said in the campaign,"" the administration official said. ""Until he sees all the options before him - and none of us can speak for him - we do not know what he will decide in the end. You can take this administrations actions on Venezuela as a guide."" The Trump administration in May placed sanctions on eight members of Venezuelas Supreme Court for stripping the countrys National Assembly of power, a move that was seen as contributing to the violent protests there. The sanctions prevent officials from traveling or doing business in the US and freeze any assets they may have abroad. The expected new policy in Cuba comes as Raul Castro appears to be finalizing his term as president. Castro has said he will step down in February 2018. Although Castro is expected to hand pick his successor, the changing of the guard on the island would give the opportunity for the Trump administration to soon deal with a less polarizing figure if relations dont significantly worsen. Before running for president, Trump had explored the possibility of opening hotels in Cuba. But on the campaign trail he took a much tougher line, threatening to cut diplomatic ties unless the government made concessions on human rights and religious freedoms. US officials said the administration was still looking at placing tighter controls on Americans visiting the island and possibly re-enacting a ban on US travelers bringing back Cuban cigars and rum, which was lifted by Obama. While the US prohibits tourism to Cuba, the US Treasury Department currently allows travelers to ""self-license"" under 12 different categories of travel, such as educational tours and participating in sporting events. But the sources said Trump could end that practice, which has created a loophole that allows almost anyone to travel to the island legally. Tightening up on those categories would likely impact earnings for the US airlines and cruise ship companies that began service to Cuba in 2016 and go against a rising anti-travel sanctions sentiment. In May, 55 US senators said they supported a bill to scrap the travel ban altogether. Trump also could overturn former President Barack Obamas Presidential Policy Directive, which laid out general parameters for the US of a policy of engagement with Cuba. But sources said such a move would be largely cosmetic and would not have much impact. Earlier this month, acting Assistant Secretary Francisco Palmieri, the State Departments top diplomat for the Western Hemisphere, told reporters a focus of Trumps revamped policy ""will be a high priority"" to ensure that ""Cuba makes further substantive progress toward greater respect for human rights in the country."" For months, Cuban officials adopted a wait-and-see attitude to Trump, with Raul Castro congratulating Trump on his electoral victory and saying he hoped to work with the new US president to continue to improve relations. But on May 20, considered by many Cubans in exile to be the islands independence day, Trump issued a statement saying, ""The Cuban people deserve a government that peacefully upholds democratic values, economic liberties, religious freedoms, and human rights, and my Administration is committed to achieving that vision."" Later that day, a Cuban state broadcaster read a statement saying Trumps views on Cuba were ""poorly advised"" and ""clumsy.""",
Trump set to unveil new Cuba policy after promising to reverse Obama's 'bad deal',https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-set-to-unveil-new-cuba-policy-after-promising-to-reverse-obamas-bad-deal/2017/06/14/ab9118fe-5126-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html,06/14/17,www.washingtonpost.com,"As President Trumps national security team worked over the past several weeks on a promised new Cuba policy designed to roll back the Obama administrations diplomatic and economic openings to the island, a steady stream of lawmakers, business leaders and Cuba experts rushed to offer guidance to the White House. With few exceptions, their advice was: Dont do it. Farm state Republicans have appealed to Trump to help them expand Cuban markets rather than close them. A newly introduced Senate bill to lift remaining travel restrictions has attracted 54 co-sponsors, including 10 Republicans. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers have called for expanding relations with the island. Major travel and agricultural companies and associations have publicly warned that a reversal would cost American jobs. U.S. and international human rights organizations, while condemning ongoing Cuban government repression, say that tightening the screws will only bolster government hard-liners, putting even more pressure on the islands nascent civil society and private sector. The Commerce and Treasury departments, which administer many Cuba regulations regarding travel and commercial activity, have explained the difficulty of a rollback after two years of business expansion and contracts. Trumps agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, told Congress last month he favored opening U.S. credit markets for Cuban agricultural imports, barred by U.S. law. On Friday, Trump plans to travel to Miami to announce a decision that senior administration officials said as recently as Wednesday had not yet been finalized. According to the Miami Herald, his speech will be delivered at the Manuel Artime Theater in Little Havana, a highly symbolic venue named after a leader of the Bay of Pigs exile invasion of Cuba in 1961, a failed U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. Trumps rhetoric will probably be ""very, very tough,"" said Mark Feierstein, the senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs in former president Barack Obamas National Security Council, who helped implement the December 2014 Obama opening that Trump has called a ""bad deal."" But the administrations changes are likely to leave in place the basic components of the Obama opening -- diplomatic relations, along with conditioned trade and travel -- while tightening each in ways that will complicate but not undo them, according to senior administration officials and several people who have lobbied them from Capitol Hill and the U.S. business community, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity about the emerging policy. The U.S. Embassy in Havana is expected to remain open but will continue without an ambassador. Existing restrictions on business dealings with the Cuban government, and especially its economically powerful military, will be made more legally explicit, and at least some planned expansions of commercial activity will be frozen. Some restrictions on American travel may be reimposed, along with limits on how often Cuban Americans can travel and send money. ""We are supportive of continued economic development, as long as it is done in full compliance with our existing statutes not to provide financial support to the regime,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Congress on Tuesday. ""The general approach,"" Tillerson said, ""is to allow as much of this continued commercial and engagement activity to go on as possible, because we do see the sunny side"" of ""benefits to the Cuban people."" The main supporters of an extensive reversal have been Cuban Americans in Congress, led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), both of whom are expected to be with Trump in Miami. Rubio, a onetime presidential candidate who clashed repeatedly with Trump during the campaign, was noticeably helpful to the White House during last weeks Senate Intelligence Committee testimony by former FBI director James B. Comey. After a long line of questions about Trumps private conversations with Comey, Rubio quickly changed the subject to the problem of leaks to the media. In an interview this week with TV Marti, the U.S. government-funded broadcaster to Cuba, Diaz-Balart said he was sure Trump would announce ""a real change"" in relations. The Cuban government headed by Raul Castro, the late Fidel Castros brother, he said, ""is a narco-terrorist tyranny, and we know President Trump understands this."" The government in Havana has remained quiet about the possible changes, although a high-ranking Cuban official told CNN this week that Raul Castro is willing to negotiate a new deal with Trump. At the core of the Cuba policy debate is a clash over the most effective way to hasten a transition to democracy on the island. Obama argued that five decades of U.S. trade sanctions had failed to achieve that goal or dislodge the Castros from power. By normalizing relations and facilitating trade and travel between Americans and Cubans, he asserted, the United States would spread democratic ideals on the island, while American diplomats could nudge the government toward greater openness in a post-Castro era. The results have been uneven. Cubas authoritarian one-party system remains largely unchanged, and dissidents say government repression has increased over the past two years. Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), the islands largest dissident group, called this month in a letter to Trump for ""maximum reversal of some policies that only benefit the Castro regime."" But supporters of engagement say its unrealistic to expect liberal democracy to bloom in two years, especially with the larger U.S. trade embargo still in force. The strategy needs more time, they argue, and policymakers should trust in the power of markets and free information to deliver desired change. Cuban authorities have acceded to some American conditions, including allowing a dramatic expansion of Internet access on the island that has shattered the information monopoly once enjoyed by Cubas state-run media. An increase in tourism and hotel construction has been one of the few bright spots in the Cuban economy. The number of U.S. visitors who are non-Cuban American increased by 74 percent in 2016, facilitated by the restoration of commercial flights between the two countries. Among more than 4 million visitors last year, a record, 615,000 came from the United States, more than half of them Cuban Americans. More than a quarter of the Cuban labor force no longer works for the communist government, from software programmers to nail salon owners, private taxi drivers and restaurant owners. Those Cubans would take a direct hit from a policy reversal. ""More than half my customers are Americans . . . the best tippers,"" said Dionys Diaz, 33, waiting for tourists outside Havanas iconic Hotel Nacional in a pink 1954 Chevy convertible. Diaz and his relatives -- including a brother-in-law in Florida -- had pooled their money to buy the vehicle and restore it, and he charges tourists $25 for rides along the Malecon esplanade. Any reversal of the opening could backfire politically, said Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat in Havana, who favors U.S. engagement. ""The hard-liners are going to have a field day."" A major rollback, he said, ""would take us back to the idea that if you punish the Cuban people, they will overthrow the government, and thats not going to happen."" Miroff reported from Havana.

(Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead) Story highlights Trump will limit some of the changes Obama made on US-Cuba policy The President is following efforts by a former GOP primary rival, Sen. Marco Rubio Washington CNN -- President Donald Trump will travel Friday to a predominantly Cuban neighborhood of Miami to announce his plan to cool the warming relations between the United States and Cuba, chipping away at yet another key aspect of former President Barack Obamas legacy. Trump will propose strictly enforcing the authorized exemptions that allow travel between the United States and Cuba and prohibiting commerce with Cuban businesses owned by the military and intelligence services, according to documents provided to CNN. Trump will also direct Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to convene a task force on expanding Internet access on the island and reiterate the United States opposition to efforts in the United Nations to lift the Cuban embargo until more is done to honor human rights. The departure is the latest example of Trump taking action to undercut his predecessors legacy. Earlier this month, Trump announced he was leaving the Paris climate accord, a deal Obama worked to strike in his second term. And Trump has made repealing Obamacare, the former presidents sweeping health care law, a top priority. Trump has been personally invested in this process, multiple aides said, adding that the President deeply believes that the changes Obama announced in 2014 were a ""bad deal for the United States and a bad deal for the Cuban people."" ""It has not led to greater freedom in Cuba,"" one official said. ""I dont think you would see him go back to the embargo wholesale, look for ways to leverage Americas influence over Cuba in a way that will encourage greater freedom for the Cuban people and economic interaction."" Tillerson said the shift in relations comes, in part, because ""Cuba has failed to improve its human rights record."" ""What we have to achieve in approaching Cuba is if were going to sustain the sunny side of the relationship, Cuba must, absolutely must, begin to address its human rights challenges,"" Tillerson said Tuesday. The actions, however, are far from a full rollback of the policies Obama champion in the latter half of his administration. Embassies in Washington and in Havana will remain open, sources tell CNN, and Cuban American travel and remittances remain unaffected. Republicans close to the plan do think some in the anti-Castro Cuban American community may be disappointed that the policy doesnt go far enough. ""The policy isnt going to do anything new,"" a source from the office of one Cuban American lawmaker complained. ""Its pretty weak."" What Trump will be changing Top Trump aides and national security officials have been meeting for weeks about Cuba, officials said, looking to nail down how far the Republican President wanted to go in hardening relations with the communist nation. While fact sheets and details have been released to different lawmakers and interest groups, an administration official said Thursday that they are still finalizing the policy. Trump, according to officials, decry the Castro regime for human rights abuses against peaceful activists and protesters and is expected to demand the extradition of Assata Shakur, a former member of the Black Panther Party who was convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper. ""Our policy is to focus effort on assisting the Cuban people, not enriching the Cuban military,"" one top adviser said, an implicit charge that the Obama administration did just that. ""Why are we committing commerce that benefits the Cuban military and intelligence services. Why arent we focusing on what benefits the Cuban people?"" The Trump administration is particularly expected to single out GAESA, the Cuban militarys business wing. The company is run by Gen. Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez-Callejas, Cuban President Raul Castros son-in-law. And on non-Cuban American travel, a change would make Americans who travel under the Obama administration categories of permitted travel subject to a Treasury Deptartment audit. This could have a cooling effect on travel as it adds a potential layer of inconvenience to travelers. Obama, after years of clandestine work with the Castro regime, announced in 2014 that the United States would re-establish diplomatic relations and reopen the American embassy in Havana, which was closed in 1961 following the Cuban revolution. The announcement led Obama to visit Cuba in 2016, making him the first sitting president to visit the island in more than 50 years. Obamas actions allowed for more Americans to travel to Cuba, leading US air carriers to market commercial flights direct to Cuba and cruise ships to port in the nation. The thaw also allowed Americans to bring more goods back from the island nation. And Trumps decision to roll back some of those efforts has angered former Obama aides, including Ben Rhodes, who led the effort to ease tensions with the Castro regime. ""Trump doesnt care about human rights anywhere. Cites HR concerns in Cuba and leading HR group opposes him acting,"" Rhodes tweeted on Tuesday, noting that the group Human Rights Watch said reversing Obamas actions ""will not improve respect for human rights on the island."" ""(Cuba) represses dissent and discourages public criticism,"" Human Rights Watch wrote in a blog post. ""But restoring restrictions on travel and commerce are unlikely to lead to improvement."" Rubio impact Just as some Democrats are maligning Trumps actions, many Republicans who decried Obamas decisions, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are supporting the President. Rubio has, for years, led the charge for toughening relations with Cuba. The son of Cuban parents, Rubio has worked closely with Trump to push tightening relations, including multiple meetings, phone calls and at least one dinner, according to officials. After Trump had dinner with Rubio in February, the President heralded the senators views on Cuban relations. ""We had dinner with Sen. Rubio and his wife, who was, by the way, lovely, and we had a very good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba,"" Trump said, adding that ""Cuban people"" were ""very good"" to him in the 2016 election. Rubios embrace of Trump on Cuba is a slight break for the Florida senator, who has been a harsh critic of Trumps views policy toward hotbed areas like Asia, the Middle East and Russia, and has faulted Trumps comments about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ""Economic practices that benefit the Cuban military at the expense of the Cuban people will soon be coming to an end,"" Rubio tweeted on Thursday. Economic practices that benefit the Cuban military at the expense of the Cuban people will soon be coming to an end #BetterDealforCuba -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 15, 2017 The Florida senator, who will attend Fridays speech, has been focused on curbing the impact of tourism on Cubas military since he introduced a bill to do just that in 2015. Rubio noted Thursday that the Cuban militarys tourism arm brags about doing business with half of all visitors to the island. A Rubio adviser said Thursday that the senators efforts are an attempt to ""lay the groundwork"" for good relations between the next generation of leaders in Cuba. Rubio, the adviser said, ""is mindful of the long term. Raul Castro and his closest advisers are mostly in their 80s. Cuba will soon have a new generation of leaders, one way or another. These policy measures are designed to lay the groundwork for that transition and empower the Cuban people to develop greater economic and political liberty."" Trump said throughout the 2016 campaign that he was willing to rollback diplomatic relations with the communist regime in Cuba. Especially in Southern Florida, where Cubans make up a key voting bloc for Republicans, Trump railed on Obama for building relations with the Castros. ""We will cancel Obamas one-sided Cuban deal,"" Trump said days before the election in Miami, ""if we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve."" He reiterated this point on Twitter after winning the election. ""If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,"" he wrote. Trump has long hanged his understanding of the deal between the United States and Cuba on his ""Cuban friends"" in Florida, whom he said throughout the campaign supported him over Democrat Hillary Clinton. To a degree, he was right: Trump did beat the former secretary of state in Florida, providing the effective knock out blow to Clinton on Election Night. Ahead of Fridays remarks, the Cuban government - including Cuban President Raul Castro - is signaling a willingness to negotiate with Trump. ""We know they have a different view of the world,"" a Cuban official told CNN. ""We understand that.""",

Carnival said it has also requested permission for its other lines to sail to Cuba. The changes Trump is expected to announce would not prohibit travel altogether. Carnival Corporation said in a statement it was pleased the new policy would allow it to continue sailing to the island nation, but that it would still need to review the ""extent of the tightening of the travel rules that could potentially affect our guests."" Travel companies reacted to reports that President Donald Trump will announce plans tomorrow to roll back former President Barack Obama 's policies loosening restrictions on travel to Cuba . Marriott International, which already has one hotel open in Cuba and another in the works, urged the Trump administration to rethink its plan.

Trump plans to curb Obama's Cuba detente,https://www.trtworld.com/americas/trump-to-clamp-down-on-cuba-travel-trade-curbing-obamas-detente-380574,06/16/17,www.trtworld.com,"President Donald Trump will announce curbs on US firms doing business with the Cuban military and tighter rules on travel to the island. Many Cubans are already crestfallen at the setback in detente even before it becomes official. Trump's measures stop well short of upending Obama-era policies, which sought to end decades of isolation that did little to dislodge Fidel and Raul Castro's regime. (TRT World and Agencies) President Donald Trump will announce plans to tighten restrictions on Americans travelling to Cuba and clamp down on US business dealings with the island's military in a visit to Miami on Friday. The move rolls back parts of former President Barack Obama's historic opening to America's former Cold War foe. Visiting the home of many Cuban exiles in the United States, Trump will issue a presidential directive to reverse some of the loosened regulations that Obama introduced after a 2014 breakthrough with Havana to improve ties for the first time in decades. TRT World's Harry Horton has more on the story from Washington DC. Trump will outline stricter enforcement of a long-time ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent US dollars from being used to fund what the new US administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. But, facing pressure from US business and some of his fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with communist-ruled Cuba, he also will leave intact many of Obama's steps toward normalisation. Cubans crestfallen at Trump's move against detente Cubans said they were crestfallen to be returning to an era of frostier relations with the US as the news spread that Trump was set to roll back Obama's opening to Cuba. ""It hurts to be going backwards. To roll back the engagement will only manage to isolate us from the world,"" said Havana resident Marta Deus, who will try to tune into Trump's speech in Miami. Deus recently set up an accountancy firm and courier service, to cater to a private sector that has flourished since Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro began to normalise relations. ""We need clients, business, we need the economy to move and by isolating Cuba, they will only manage to hurt many Cuban families and force companies to close,"" she said. The 2014 deal sparked widespread euphoria in Cuba and raised hopes for an improvement in its ailing economy. An increased arrival of US tourists thanks to eased restrictions fuelled a boom in tourism, especially in Havana, creating demand for more BnBs, restaurants, taxis and tour guides in the fledgling private sector. Human rights as rationale for the roll back Critics say the opening failed to improve rights on the island. Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama's measures to a large extent on those grounds, White House officials said. Some Cuban dissidents back his tougher stance, saying repression has worsened since the detente. Cuban authorities have stepped up their detentions of activists, often confiscating their telephones and laptops, but they have also been coming down with a heavy hand on self- employed Cubans who appear to be empowering themselves. ""When the Obama administration stopped condemning human rights violations in Cuba, the regime here said 'look we can do this and nothing happens, so we can continue repressing more forcefully',"" said Jose Daniel Ferrer, who leads the Patriotic Union of Cuba, the country's largest dissident group. Ferrer said his group had 53 activists currently imprisoned due to their political views. Roll back likely to impact citizens more than government Other dissidents agree repression has worsened but say rolling back the detente, which will hurt ordinary Cubans, is not the solution. ""It will probably not have any benefit in terms of human rights,"" said Eliecer Avila, the leader of the opposition youth group Somos Mas. The Cuban government has withstood the US trade embargo for more than a half century and will not make any political concessions to the United States due to economic pressure, said Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat. ""I am concerned it will affect the private sector quite a bit and much more than the Cuban government,"" he said. This new setback to the Cuban economy will come at a time when it is already wrestling with falling oil shipments from crisis-stricken ally Venezuela and a decline in exports.

Trump rolls back parts of what he calls 'terrible' Obama Cuba policy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba-idUSKBN1970EC,06/16/17,www.reuters.com,"MIAMI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and a clampdown on U.S. business dealings with the Caribbean islands military, saying he was canceling former President Barack Obamas ""terrible and misguided deal"" with Havana. Laying out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, Trump signed a presidential directive rolling back parts of Obamas historic opening to the Communist-ruled country after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. But Trump left in place many of Obamas changes, including the reopened U.S. embassy in Havana, even as he sought to show he was making good on a campaign promise to take a tougher line against Cuba, especially over its human rights record. ""We will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer,"" Trump told a cheering crowd in Miamis Cuban-American enclave of Little Havana, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who helped forge the new restrictions on Cuba. ""Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administrations completely one-sided deal with Cuba,"" Trump declared as he made a full-throated assault on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. Cuba later denounced the move as a setback in U.S.-Cuban relations, saying Trump had been badly advised and was resorting to ""coercive methods of the past"" that were doomed to fail. The government remained willing to engage in ""respectful dialogue,"" it said in a statement. Trumps revised approach calls for stricter enforcement of a longtime ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists, and seeks to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the Trump administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) But, facing pressure from U.S. businesses and even some fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with Cuba, the president chose to leave intact some of his Democratic predecessors steps toward normalization. The new policy bans most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a Cuban conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy. But it makes some exceptions, including for air and sea travel, according to U.S. officials. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines serving the island. ""We do not want U.S. dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba,"" Trump said, pledging that U.S. sanctions would not be lifted until Cuba frees political prisoners and holds free elections. While the changes are far-reaching, they appear to be less sweeping than many U.S. pro-engagement advocates had feared. Trump based his partial reversal of Obamas Cuba measures largely on human rights grounds. His critics, however, have questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for human rights abuses but downplaying the issue in other parts of the world, including Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally Trump visited last month where political parties and protests are banned. SOME OBAMA POLICIES LEFT IN PLACE Trump, however, stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostilities. He also will not cut off recently resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights or cruise-ship travel, though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall. The administration, according to one White House official, has no intention of ""disrupting"" existing business ventures such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels Inc, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a historic Havana hotel. Nor does Trump plan to reinstate limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the islands coveted rum and cigars that Americans can bring home for personal use. Still, it will be the latest attempt by Trump to overturn parts of Obamas presidential legacy. He has already pulled the United States out of a major international climate treaty and is trying to scrap his predecessors landmark healthcare program. When Obama announced the detente in 2014, he said that decades of U.S. efforts to achieve change in Cuba by isolating the island had failed and it was time to try a new approach. Critics of the rapprochement said Obama was giving too much away without extracting concessions from the Cuban government. Castros government has clearly stated it does not intend to change its one-party political system. Trump aides say Obamas efforts amounted to ""appeasement"" and have done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Slideshow ( 13 images ) ""Its hard to think of a policy that makes less sense than the prior administrations terrible and misguided deal with the Castro regime,"" Trump said in Miami. International human rights groups say, however, that renewed U.S. efforts to isolate the island could worsen the situation by empowering Cuban hard-liners. The Cuban government, which has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms, had no immediate comment. But ordinary Cubans said they were crestfallen to be returning to an era of frostier relations with the United States with potential economic fallout for them. ""Its like we are returning to the Cold War,"" said Cuban designer Idania del Rio, who joined a group of friends in a hotel in Old Havana to watch the speech in English on CNN. Slideshow ( 13 images ) Trump announced his new approach at the Manuel Artime Theater in the heart of the United States largest Cuban-American and Cuban exile community, whose support aides believe helped him win Florida in the election. The venue is named after a leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 against Fidel Castros revolutionary government. ""I have trust in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to Cuba,"" said Jorge Saurez, 66, a retired physician in Little Havana. Trumps vow to keep the broader decades-old U.S. economic embargo on Cuba firmly in place drew criticism from some U.S. farmers, especially growers of corn, soybeans and rice. Obamas detente has already lifted exports and raised hopes for more gains, which they said were now in doubt. Mexicos foreign ministry urged the United States and Cuba to resolve their differences ""via dialogue."" But Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose leftist government is Cubas main regional ally, slammed Trumps tightening of restrictions as an ""offence"" against Latin America. ""His speech was aggressive and threatening, ... revealing his contempt and ignorance,"" President Nicolas Maduro said in a speech. ""We reject Donald Trumps declarations against our brother Cuba. It is an offence against Latin America."" The biggest change in travel policy will be that Americans making educational people-to-people trips, one of the most popular authorized categories, can no longer go to the island on their own but only on group tours. Trumps aides said the aim was to close off a path for Americans seeking beach vacations in a country where U.S. tourism is still officially banned. U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, one of the Republican Partys most vocal advocates for easing rules on U.S. dealings with Cuba, called for a vote on legislation lifting restrictions on American travel there. But the Republican leadership in Congress has long blocked such a move, and it appears unlikely to budge. Under Trumps order, the Treasury and Commerce departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations, which will not take effect until they are complete. In contentious deliberations leading up to the new policy, some aides argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency vowing to unleash U.S. business, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to Cuban-Americans.",
Trump cancels Obama's deal with Cuba,https://nypost.com/2017/06/16/trump-cancels-obamas-deal-with-cuba/,06/16/17,nypost.com,"President Trump on Friday demanded that Cuba surrender cop-killer Joanne Chesimard and other US fugitives the communist regime has been harboring. ""Return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop-killer Joanne Chesimard,"" he thundered to applause and shouts of ""Viva Trump"" in Miamis Little Havana, where he signed a bill undoing parts of the Obama administrations efforts to ease relations with the communist nation. ""To the Castro regime, I repeat, the harboring of criminals and fugitives will end. You have no choice. It will end,"" he declared. ""We will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer,"" he said as the crowd chanted, ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" ""America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand for the freedom of the Cuban people. We will work for the day when a new generation of leaders brings this long reign of suffering to an end. And I do believe that end is within the very near future."" Chesimard, a Queens-born activist who later changed her name to Assata Shakur, was a Black Liberation Army member convicted in 1977 of murdering a New Jersey state trooper. The trooper, Werner Foerster, was killed May 1973 in a shootout with BLA members, including Chesimard, on the New Jersey Turnpike. Another trooper, James Harper, was wounded. Harpers wife, Hilde, agreed that Chesimard should be handed over, telling The Post, ""Yes, wed like to bring her back."" Chesimard escaped from prison with the help of other BLA terrorists and fled to Cuba in 1984, where Fidel Castros regime granted her political asylum, which has continued with Castros brother Raul in office. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), a Cuban-American, praised the changes announced Friday as well as Trumps demand for Chesimards return. ""Todays announcement is a step in the right direction to reverse an ill-advised and misguided Cuba policy that has failed to deliver on its promises, left the Cuban people worse off, and allowed American fugitives, like wanted terrorist and cop-killer Joanne Chesimard, to escape justice,"" Menendez said. Under Trumps policy, travel for nonacademic educational purposes will be limited to authorized groups, with self-directed individual travel no longer allowed. Cuban-Americans will still be able to visit their families in Cuba and send them money. A senior administration official told reporters that hotels and other businesses linked to the regimes military, intelligence services and security apparatus would be off limits to Americans. Although wildly cheered at Fridays event in Miamis Manuel Artime Theater, Trumps move falls short of his campaign promise to entirely undo President Barack Obamas Cuba policy, which he had called ""terrible and misguided."" Among those attending was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a former presidential rival he mocked as ""Little Marco"" but praised on Friday as ""a tough competitor."" Also there was a member of the Ladies in White, a Cuban dissident group made up of the spouses of political prisoners held by the Castro regime. Outside the event, protesters slammed the changes. ""The Cuban people want more Americans coming. They want opportunity. They live off these tips they make in the private sector,"" Patrick Hidalgo, a Cuban-American activist, told Miamis NBC News affiliate. Some Senate Republicans, including Jeff Flake of Arizona and Jerry Moran of Kansas, criticized the changes, with Moran saying they would cut off a market for US exports. With Post Wire Services",
Trump Reverses Pieces of Obama-Era Engagement With Cuba,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/cuba-trump-engagement-restrictions.html,06/16/17,www.nytimes.com,"On Friday, Mr. Trump sought to revive that struggle, listing the misdeeds of the Castro government over more than five decades. ""We will never, ever be blind to it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We remember what happened."" His audience of Cuban exiles and their families, including Mr. Rubio and Mr. Diaz-Balart, roared its approval. ""President Trump will treat the Castro regime as the malevolent dictatorship that it is,"" Mr. Diaz-Balart said. But critics argued that Mr. Trump was returning to a strategy that had been a proven failure. Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for Mr. Obama who led secret negotiations with Cuban officials that led to the rapprochement, said Mr. Trumps moves would undermine his stated objectives, pushing the Cubans into the arms of the Chinese and Russians, who have no restrictions on their dealings there, and emboldening hard-liners in the country who are opposed to moving toward democracy. ""If you want Cuba to change and reform, we are doing the opposite of what would be most likely to bring about reforms inside of Cuba,"" Mr. Rhodes said. But some Cuban dissidents who had backed Mr. Obamas thaw in the hopes it would lead to greater openness on the island said the opposite had occurred. Among them was Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, head of the Cuban Patriotic Union, the largest opposition group in Cuba, who was among the dissidents Mr. Obama met last year in Cuba. ""We believe that this is the moment for a maximum reversal of some policies that only benefit the Castro regime and does very little or nothing for the oppressed people,"" Mr. Ferrer wrote in an open letter to Mr. Trump last week. ""It is time to impose strong sanctions on the regime of Raul Castro."" Under Mr. Trumps directive, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will have 30 days to begin writing new travel and commercial regulations. They are instructed to reverse a rule that Mr. Obama put in place last year to allow Americans who are making educational or cultural trips to initiate their own travel to Cuba without special permission from the United States government and without a licensed tour company, as long as they kept records of their activities for five years.",

Freely Wandering in Cuba Gets Harder to Do Under Trump,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/freely-wandering-cuba-gets-harder-do-under-trump-n773566,06/16/17,www.nbcnews.com,"WASHINGTON -- A two-time veteran of travel to Cuba, librarian AJ Johnson lamented Friday that his plan to return to the island next year with his wife and children is unlikely, now that President Donald Trump retightened restrictions on Americans visits there. Johnson, a librarian for Caribbean studies with the University of Texas at Austin Benson Latin American Collections, was eager for his children to see ""how people live in a different place and [to] teach them about the world."" He figured when he returned next year, theyd vacation while he worked. Even though Trump didn't bulldoze former President Barack Obamas historic renewal of U.S.-Cuba relations, he did close an avenue that Americans were beginning to use to do their own exploring of their Caribbean neighbor. Trumps changes include eliminating the individual ""people-to-people"" category under which Americans could go to Cuba without booking a trip with a group or without pre-arranged travel agendas. Related: Trump Announces Changes to 'One-Sided' Obama Cuba Policy ""I was there when they announced that Obama was going to visit,"" Johnson told NBC Latino about his Cuba travel. ""The country erupted. Everywhere I went, every single group of people, I could hear them talking about Obama coming. There were parties in the streets ... I know the people of Cuba are so excited about opening up and the possibility of Americans coming."" Johnson also was Cuba in 2000 on a scripted trip for work, going from place to place on a bus and touring locations picked for the group. He only managed an off-script look at Cuba when he snuck away from the trips organized Communist block party. Johnson recalled that on the first trip food was spare, but last year, food carts were abundant, Airbnb lodgings and private restaurants were available. Johnson also indulged his passion for birding, connecting with a driver who knew birding locations, and driving around the island with him. ""Last year when I went I was cien por ciento (100 percent) on my own,"" Johnson said. Tourists eat in a restaurant in Havana, Cuba, June 16, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini ALEXANDRE MENEGHINI / Reuters Despite promises to wholly reverse Obamas Cuba initiative, Trump's alterations were limited. Gustavo Arnavat, who helped the administration rewrite the U.S.-Cuba relationship, said the limited changes confirm ""President Obamas determination that engagement [with Cuba] is the right thing to do and is in the best interest of Americans national security and economic interests."" Arnavat, a former director for the U.S. Interamerican Development Bank and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the change could have an effect on air travel and reduce demand for goods and services provided by Cubans in the emerging private sector, such as rooms in private homes, known as casas particulares, and private retaurants known as paladares. ""But the good news is that it appears that the regulations with respect to family travel will not be affected, so we are not going back to the bad days under the Bush administration, when you could travel once every three years to visit immediate relatives. I think Cubans should be breathing a sight of relief,"" Arnavat said. While Cuban Americans once were stalwart in their support of the U.S. policy of isolation of Cuba, they now are much more polarized over liberalizing relations with Cuba, evidenced Friday by reaction of people paying close attention to Trumps announcement at Miamis Manuel Artime Theater, named after a veteran of the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, a 1961 U.S. attempt to overthrow Cubas Castro government. A group of relatives, including a mother and her two teenage daughters, who support Trump, welcomed his backing up on openness with Cuba. ""A slight reversal is a great accomplishment,"" Rosamelia Gonzalez said. Her fathers cousins were imprisoned and executed in Cuba. When her 33 year-old nephew in Cuba passed away from cancer in February, she made the tough decision not to go. ""Its a difficult choice to make,"" she said. Gonzalez and others believe that travel to Cuba helps financially support and perpetuate the communist government. ""Any American citizen that travels to Cuba is funding the government's terrorism against its own citizens,"" her 14-year-old daughter, Grethel Aguila, said. Supporters of President Donald Trump's new Cuba policy cheer near the Manuel Artime theater in East Little Havana as he announces changes to former President Barack Obama's Cuba policies on June 17, 2017. Carmen Sesin / NBC News Lorenzo Canizares, a member of the Labor Community Alliance, which helped organize an anti-Trump protest at the theater, fled Cuba in 1962. He supported the U.S. embargo until the 1980s when he had a change of heart. ""This process cannot be done with hate,"" he said. He tried to travel to Cuba in 2003 as part of the group Cuban Committee for Democracy, but the Cuban government denied him and two others visas, he said. Still, he wants rapprochement with Cuba. ""We dont want to return to the past,"" he said. The change does not mean all travel will be restricted. There are plenty of travel companies that offer trips and there are other categories that Americans can use, if they qualify, for authorized travel to Cuba, such as family, business, journalistic activity, professional research and others. But Trump's slight retreat from warmer relations with Cuba will also mean that people who can travel there will go through more rigorous regulation to verify they are eligible to travel under the categories allowed, said Pedro Freyre, chair of international practice for Akerman LLP. Freyre represents U.S. companies that do business with Cuba. Lorenzo Ca?izares, who feld Cuba in 1962, protested Trump's new Cuba policy near the Manuel Artime theater in East Little Havana on June 16, 2017. Carmen Sesin / NBC News ""It's a chilling effect and then this sort of drives a downward spiral and that helps make the argument in the future that no one is going and you can impose more restrictions because no one is going,"" Freyre said. Icess Fernandez Rojas, a writer and an assistant professor of English at Lone Star College-Kingwood in Houston, Texas, had just begun planning a trip with a friend to Cuba that they were going to take on their own. Fernandez has family on the island and planned to do some freelance writing from there, while her friend planned to do some travel blogging. ""I'm literally here waiting to see whats happening,"" she said before Trumps plans for Cuba policies became official. In the end, she and her friend decided they would still make the trip and travel under the journalists category. Patrick Hidalgo, a former Obama administration official who helped organize Friday's protest against Trump's Cuba announcement, was relieved the administration didn't touch remittances, money Cuban Americans send back to families on the island, as well as other things loosened under Obama. Hidalgo said Sen. Marco Rubio and the ""powers that be have taken note that our community will not tolerate these guys trading things like health care and the Russia investigation for a hardline Cuba policy,"" he said.

Trump 'canceling' Obama's Cuba policy but leaves much in place,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-cuba-policy/story?id=48058622,06/17/17,abcnews.go.com,"-- After nearly three years of warming relations between the United States and Cuba, President Donald Trump has announced that his administration will unravel many of his predecessors policies on the communist state. Speaking in Miami, Florida, Trump announced changes to President Barack Obamas historic rapprochement with Cuba -- fulfilling a promise to the anti-Castro voting bloc he believes helped his campaign clinch the state, but stirring fear among others he could set back business interests and Cubas potential for a more prosperous private sector. The Cuban government said in a statement published in the state-run newspaper Granma, ""Again, the United States Government resorted to coercive methods of the past, adopting measures to intensify the blockade, in force since February 1962, which not only causes damage and deprivation to the Cuban people and constitutes an undeniable obstacle to the development of our economy, but also affects the sovereignty and interests of other countries, inciting international rejection."" The statement continues, ""The Cuban Government denounces the new measures to tighten the blockade, which are destined to fail as has been shown repeatedly in the past, and which will not achieve its purpose to weaken the revolution or to defeat the Cuban people, whose resistance to the aggressions of any type and origin has been proven over almost six decades."" Decades of contention before Obama In one form or another, the embargo on Cuba has been in place since the Eisenhower administration. But beginning in late 2014, Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro began a process that gradually thawed diplomatic tensions and eased commercial and travel restrictions between the two countries. This process culminated in significant economic opportunities for both the U.S. and Cuba. American businesses, including airlines, cruise lines, and telecommunications companies, earned 26 agreements with the Cuban government from 2015 to 2017. Hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars flowed into privately owned businesses in Cuba, The Associated Press reported , spurring the growth of a nascent middle-class that could thrive independent from the government. For Cuba, there have been tangible benefits in tourism and telecommunications. According to the Cuban Ministry, 74 percent more American citizens visited the island in 2016 than in 2015 and, following through on a pledge to Obama, Castro opened nearly 400 new public Wi-Fi access points around Cuba. However, the U.S. International Trade Administration told ABC News it hasn't yet released its 2016 statistics on outbound travel and therefore could not confirm those numbers from the Cuban Ministry on U.S. tourism. While Obama did not end the embargo on Cuba, since only Congress has that power, the U.S. and Cuba reopened embassies in each others capitals for the first time since 1961. The U.S. and Cuba have also signed multiple bilateral agreements to work together on everything from human and drug trafficking to maritime security and migration. Finally, Obama ended the ""wet foot, dry foot"" immigration policy that applied only to Cubans. Previously, Cubans who reached U.S. shores earned automatic visas. Now, Cubans have to follow the same process as other refugees and immigrants. What is Trump reversing? Trump is not reversing all of Obamas changes, but he is redefining what it means to be part of the Cuban military, which could prevent U.S. companies from doing business in Cuba. The White House explained in a fact sheet released earlier today that the policy aims to keep the Grupo de Administracion Empresarial (GAESA), a conglomerate managed by the Cuban military, from benefiting from the opening in U.S.-Cuba relations. ""The profits from investment and tourism flow directly to the military. The regime takes the money and owns the industry,"" Trump said. ""The outcome of last administration's executive action has been only more repression and a move to crush the peaceful democratic movement. Therefore, effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with Cuba."" This comes amid concerns that the Cuban military could be the beneficiary of increased American private investment, at a time when Castro has failed to take action on human rights. In 2016, there were 9,940 short-term detentions of protesters, up from 8,899 in 2014, the AP reports. According to senior White House officials, Trump is also revisiting trade and travel policies toward Cuba, clamping down on individual people-to-people travel. There will still be certain exceptions under which Americans can travel to Cuba and family travel will continue to be authorized. Importantly, no changes will go into effect until the Treasury and Commerce Departments issue new regulations that conform with the administration's policy. Trump continued, ""We will not lift sanctions on the Cuban regime until all political prisoners are free, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, all political parties are legalized and free and internationally supervised elections are scheduled."" The changes will certainly harm relations between Cuba and the U.S. In a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson explained, ""The general approach, if I can say that, is to allow as much of this continued commercial and engagement activity to go on as possible because we do see the sunny side, as I described it. We do see the benefits of that to the Cuban people."" But then Tillerson qualified his statement. ""On the other hand, we think we've achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior of the regime in Cuba and its treatment of people,"" he said, ""and it has little incentive to change that."" What about diplomatic ties? Senior White House officials say that Trump will not close the newly re-opened U.S. Embassy in Havana. He will also not reinstate the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy. To avoid alienating the Cuban-American community, which largely votes Republican, Trump will not re-implement limits on remittances -- U.S. based money transfers -- that Cuban-Americans can give their families back on the island. But if the administration follows through on redefining what it means to be part of the Cuban military, that could affect policies on remittances down the line. Lobbying Trump on Cuba Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, both Republican, Cuban-American hardliners, lobbied Trump hard toward reversal. Importantly, the Trump administration wants to build good rapport with both. Rubio sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is currently looking into the Trump campaigns supposed contacts with Russian officials. He spoke in Miami briefly before Trump took the stage. Rubio and Diaz-Balart won out, though theres no shortage of actors lobbying the White House the other way. Last week, a group of House Republicans sent a letter to Trump opposing ""reversing course"" on Cuba. A similar group of Senate Republicans wrote to Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, citing the entrepreneurial and national security benefits of continued engagement. Airbnb, Google and other notable businesses have also spoken out recently in support of maintaining current policies. Tillerson had privately expressed support for Obamas Cuba policy during the transition, according to sources. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, when governor of Georgia in 2010, led a delegation to Cuba and said at the time to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""I think business cures a lot of ills."" Leading human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have also urged the administration to keep Cuba open. ""More travel, more communications access, and more dialogue with Cuba are the way forward for human rights in Cuba,"" Amnesty International wrote in a blog post, adding that Obamas trip to Cuba last year opened the door to ""scrutiny and transparency"" of human rights on the island for the first time in nearly 10 years. Reversing policy is bad for Cubans, Human Rights Watch said in a statement, ""and insisting on human rights progress as a precondition to a new policy is unlikely to bring about change."" What did Candidate Trump say? During the campaign, Candidate Trump slammed Obamas Cuba policy, telling a crowd in Miami: ""All the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them. And that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands."" But at the same time, Trump often criticizes regulations on the business community as ""burdensome"" and ""job-killing."" Today's speech Delivering a speech at the historic Manuel Artime Theater in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, Trump made his policy known in the center of the Cuban-American community. The president fed off of a boisterous, rowdy crowd, seeming to even attempt a Cuban accent, shouting ""Little Havana!"" when he took the stage. By rescinding certain Obama-era Cuba policies, he went against the advice of Democrats, Republicans and business interests. He did, however, fulfill a campaign promise.

Castro blames Trump for 'setback' in US-Cuba relations,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/7/15/castro-blames-trump-for-setback-in-us-cuba-relations,07/15/17,www.aljazeera.com,"Trump announced tightened rules for Americans traveling to Cuba and reaffirmed existing US trade embargo last month. Donald Trump's hardline stance towards Cuba marks ""a setback"" in its relations with the United States after ties were gradually restored in 2015, President Raul Castro said. Castro criticised Trumps partial rollback of his predecessor Barack Obama's rapprochement with the communist island in comments made less than a week before the second anniversary of Havana embassys reopening in Washington on July 20. ""The announcements made by the current president ... mean a setback in bilateral relations,"" Castro said in remarks, broadcast on state television, at the closing of the first session of Cubas Parliament on Friday. Castros remarks came after Trump in June - standing before a crowd of anti-Castro activists in Miamis Little Havana - announced tightened rules for Americans travelling to Cuba, banned ties with a military-run tourism firm and reaffirmed the existing US trade embargo. The Cuban president called the new measures a toughening of the US embargo against the island, imposed since 1962, saying they evoked ""an old and hostile rhetoric that characterised the Cold War"". In his first public riposte to Trump since the latter unveiled his new Cuba policy last month, Castro told the national assembly that any attempt to topple the revolution would fail, as it had under 11 previous US presidents. ""We reject the manipulation of the topic of human rights against Cuba, that can be proud of much in this area, and does not need to receive lessons from the United States nor anyone."" Castro said Cuba remained open to negotiating matters of bilateral interest with the US, sticking to the relatively conciliatory tone it has struck of late. ""Cuba and the United States can cooperate and live side by side, respecting their differences,"" he said. ""But no one should expect that for this, one should have to make concessions inherent to ones sovereignty and independence."" Castro said Trump had clearly been ill-informed about Cubas history with the US and Cubans patriotism. Castro has seven months to go before he steps down as president, although he will remain head of the Communist Party, in which political power is vested in Cuba. His generation, which has ruled Cuba since the 1959 revolution, is dying.",
Cuban State Media Confirms: Havana Runs Out of Toilet Paper,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/12/04/cuban-media-havana-toilet-paper/,12/04/17,www.breitbart.com,"A Cuban state media outlet confirmed last week that the nations capital, Havana, is suffering significant shortages of toilet paper. While the absence of common goods in the communist nation is not uncommon, such acknowledgment of a problem is rare. The state newspaper Juventud Rebelde (""Rebellious Youth"") reported on Wednesday that toilet paper had ""disappeared"" from stores in Havana, announcing that the governments state-run producer of toilet paper had acquired new machinery to generate toilet paper. ""They are not the super-machines, but they have an elevated technology level,"" toilet paper engineer Manolo Gonzalez Garcia told the newspaper. One advantage of the new machines, he explains, is that they can simultaneously churn out two types of toilet paper rolls: a high-quality one for tourists, and an ""ecological"" one to sell to Cuban citizens. The Miami-based Cuban news outlet Marti Noticias noted this week that Havana has suffered major shortages of toilet paper ""for weeks"" before Juventud Rebelde reported on them. Diario de Cuba adds that the Castro regime has begun importing higher numbers of toilet paper rolls from Vietnam while it adjusts its ability to produce the paper domestically, citing Spanish newswire service EFE. While Cuban communist media covering the shortages may be new, EFE notes that ""toilet paper shortages have been a constant in Cuban homes since the crisis of the 1990s, leading many families to use official state newspaper as toilet paper."" After decades of having its communist government subsidized by the Soviet Union, Cuba suffered what the Castro regime has dubbed the ""special period"" of extreme poverty following the collapse of its patron in the 1990s. Cuba has since established a close relationship with Venezuela, which has provided free oil and key resources to keep the regime afloat. Venezuela itself, thanks to the imposition of a similar socialist economic system to that of Cuba, began experiencing toilet paper shortages in 2013. By 2015, Venezuelan luxury hotels began requesting that visitors bring their own toilet paper into the country to guarantee they would have access to it. That year, the Venezuelan government cut a deal with Trinidad and Tobago to essentially buy toilet paper with its crude oil, which did little to stop the shortages. The Venezuelan military announced this year that soldiers participating in the violent repression of anti-socialist protests could expert to be rewarded with rolls of toilet paper. Venezuelas oil reserves have not been enough to stop toilet paper shortages in Cuba, just as they have failed Venezuela. In 2009, for example, Miamis El Nuevo Herald reported on the growing popularity of the previously noted phenomenon of using communist propaganda as toilet paper--not as a political statement, but out of necessity. Toilet paper is particularly hard to find because ""it is not included in the ration cards that cover basic products at highly subsidized prices."" ""Chinese and North Korean magazines are the favorites because of the softness of the paper,"" the Herald noted at the time. Far more recently, in October, Diario Las Americas cited Hurricane Irma as having significantly hurt Cubans ability to acquire basic good like toilet paper. At the time, an unnamed official told the newspaper that ""there is no such shortage"" of paper, denying what the government would apparently find itself with no choice but to accept as reality a month later. The Cuban government has consistently blamed the U.S. embargo on trade with the communist nation for its economic woes, despite the fact that Cuba has the rest of the worlds markets open to it and maintains friendly relations with economic giants like China. While President Barack Obama lifted some restrictions on American business in Cuba, those have largely served to enrich government-owned entities on the island.

Cuba signals Raul Castro will remain president longer than expected,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/cuba-signals-raul-castro-will-remain-president-longer-than-expected/2017/12/21/3ba1bfac-e678-11e7-927a-e72eac1e73b6_story.html,12/21/17,www.washingtonpost.com,"Cuban President Raul Castro will remain in power until April, the government said Thursday, delaying a historic transition that would leave the communist island nation without a Castro in charge for the first time since 1959. The brother of former Cuban leader and revolutionary figure Fidel Castro, who died in 2016, Raul Castro, 86, had previously announced he would step aside when a new National Assembly was elected on Feb. 24. But the assembly decided Thursday to postpone the vote -- and prolong Castros mandate -- until April 19, citing delays and complications related to destruction inflicted by Hurricane Irma, according to official Cuban news outlets. Observers suggested the powers that be in Havana may actually be angling for more time as they struggle to build a consensus over the path ahead. [Trump: Well get Cuba straightened out] The vote comes as Cubas thaw with the United States under President Barack Obama has turned frosty under the Trump administration, and as its own hard-liners question just how fast the island nation should embrace reform. Meanwhile, one of its closest allies -- Venezuela -- is mired in a deep economic crisis, unable to provide Cuba with as much cheap crude as it used to under an energy-for-doctors deal struck in 2000. ""Theyre very nervous about this transition,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. ""Its going to go forward, but the Trump administration has thrown a wrench into their thinking, and they want to make sure things are going to go according to plan."" Obamas historic visit to Cuba in 2016 -- the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928 -- promised a new dawn in long-problematic U.S.-Cuba relations. But the prospects for change have darkened. [When President Obama moved to normalize relations with Cuba] This year, U.S. officials said that at least 24 American staff members and spouses attached to its embassy in Havana were the victims of a mysterious attack that left at least some with brain trauma, affecting vision, balance and memory. Cuba has strongly denied any wrongdoing and protested the October expulsion of 15 of its diplomats from its new embassy in Washington. President Trump also has curbed the less-restrictive rules on Americans traveling to Cuba enacted under Obama. The Cubans, meanwhile, have sent conflicting signals. Hard-liners have been pushing back against an accelerated economic opening. In August, Cuba at least temporarily suspended new business licenses, including for bed-and-breakfasts and restaurants. In October, however, the nations Foreign Ministry appeared to offer an olive branch to Cubans who fled the country in the 1950s during the Cuban revolution, introducing rules that make it easier for them to visit. ""There is a clear battle between those who want to speed up and those who want to slow down economic reform,"" said Geoff Thale, a Cuba expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, a think tank. It remained unclear whether Thursdays move signaled an attempt, preferred by some on the island, to keep Castro as leader for even longer. The man currently tapped for the job of leading a post-Castro era is First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The 57-year-old was born after the revolution, and his ascension would signify a new generation of leadership. Some have suggested he could be more of a moderate, though there is evidence to the contrary. A leaked video of Diaz-Canel in a private meeting with Communist Party members showed him threatening to block a website -- OnCuba, which he accused of being ""very aggressive against the revolution"" -- and accusing European diplomats of subversive activities in Havana.

"Cuba votes for new National Assembly, opens door to major political change as end of Castro era looms on the horizon-World News , Firstpost",https://www.firstpost.com/world/cuba-votes-for-new-national-assembly-opens-door-to-major-political-change-as-end-of-castro-era-looms-on-the-horizon-4386103.html,03/12/18,www.firstpost.com,"Cubans voted to ratify a new National Assembly, a key step leading to the elevation of a new president, the first in 60 years from outside the Castro family. Havana, Cuba: Cubans voted on Sunday to ratify a new National Assembly, a key step in a process leading to the elevation of a new president, the first in nearly 60 years from outside the Castro family. The new members of the National Assembly will be tasked with choosing a successor to 86-year-old President Raul Castro when he steps down in April. ""The next president may not have that surname, but he will undoubtedly be a son of the Revolution,"" the Foreign Ministry said on Twitter. Castro voted in the southeastern province of Santiago de Cuba while his first vice-president and likely successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel, cast his ballot in the central Santa Clara province. ""The triumphal march of the revolution will continue,"" Diaz-Canel said after voting, promising ""peace, liberty, independence and the sovereignty of the people will endure."" Raul Castro took over in 2006 from his ailing brother Fidel, who had governed since seizing power during the 1959 revolution. Eight million Cubans were expected to turn out to ratify 605 candidates for an equal number of seats in the Assembly, a process shorn of suspense and unique to the Communist-run Caribbean island nation. ""They're the most important elections of recent years, because we are going to vote for new people who will govern from then on,"" daycare centre guardian Ramon Perez told AFP. Sunday's general election is the first since the 2016 death of Fidel Castro, and marks the beginning of major change at the top in Cuba. The change ""will be a challenge but it's the natural law of life. We get old and have to retire,"" said retired lieutenant colonel Rigoberto Celorio, 82. ""This is the right moment,"" he added. ""Raul will stay on as first secretary of the Communist Party, so whoever comes out of the process will be well oriented."" Candidates may be either members of the Cuban Communist Party or not, and may also belong to trade unions or be students. ""The designation of candidates is based on merit, abilities and the commitment of the people,"" Raul Castro said when he announced the elections in 2017. The official daily Granma wrote: ""Nobody exchanges promises for votes, or boasts of his abilities to get supporters... This is the true and exceptional face of what we proudly call socialist democracy."" Succession More than half of the candidates, 322, are women. The new National Assembly selects a 31-member Council of State, whose head is automatically president of the country. Castro had already announced that he would not be seeking a new term, although he is expected to remain head of the all-powerful Communist Party until 2021. Diaz-Canel, 57, is widely expected to succeed him and is committed to guaranteeing continuity. Born after the revolution, the engineer slowly climbed to the top rungs of Cuba's hierarchy over a three-decade career under Raul's mentorship. ""Diaz-Canel is a person known to us. I sincerely wish it will be him,"" said Xiomara Gonzalez, after voting in Diaz-Canel's home town of Santa Clara. Julio Cesar Guanche, a professor of law and history, said on the OnCuba website that the legitimacy of the country's next president would come more from ""institutional performance"" than personal history such as involvement in the 1959 revolution. Turnout for the election is expected to be around 90 percent. Although voting is voluntary, not voting is frowned upon. Going to the polls is considered an act of sovereignty and of ""revolutionary affirmation."" The final results will be announced on Monday. Opposition criticism of the process centres around the fact that the president is not chosen in direct elections. Cuban dissident Rosa Maria Paya, of the Cuba Decide movement, wants a referendum on modifying the island's government system and says her group will be watching for signs ""of rejection of the electoral process, in which in reality we cannot elect"" anyone. US lawmakers headed by Republican Marco Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, have written to President Donald Trump urging him to ignore Castro's successor ""in the absence of free, fair and multiparty elections."" Cubans who want to demonstrate opposition typically spoil their ballots. The Otro18 opposition movement is also calling for change. ""The citizens do not participate in the choice or the election of the president and we think it's a decisive moment for the citizens to push a request"" to change the electoral system, said Ostro18 leader Manuel Costa Morua.",
"Miguel Diaz-Canel, Raul Castro's likely successor in Cuba, favors hard line against US and dissidents",https://www.foxnews.com/world/miguel-diaz-canel-raul-castros-likely-successor-in-cuba-favors-hard-line-against-us-and-dissidents,04/04/18,www.foxnews.com,"On April 19, for the first time in almost 60 years, Cuba likely will have a leader whose last name is not Castro. Raul Castro, who took over as leader in 2008 after his brother Fidel became too ill to continue as president, is stepping down at the age of 86 and Cubas sitting vice president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, is expected to succeed him. The end of the era of Castro regimes comes after a dramatic turn in U.S.-Cuba relations under the Obama administration, which restored diplomatic relations, followed by renewed tensions after Donald Trump took office and said that he would not continue the march toward friendship with a nation that had made no real democratic reforms. Once viewed as more open to democracy than the Castro brothers, Diaz-Canel, 57, is likely to continue hard-line policies and a governing style that bows to the Communist revolution, which took place before he was born. Last year, a leaked video of a private meeting of the Cuban Communist Party showed Diaz-Canel denouncing dissidents, the United States and independent journalists -- while sharing conspiracy theories about how opponents of the Communist revolution were trying to infiltrate elections and run for office. Echoing the rhetoric that Fidel and Raul Castro favored for building resentment on the island toward the United States, Diaz-Canel said the U.S. government was determined to conquer Cuba economically and politically, and said he found the Trump administration ""offensive."" Diaz-Canel said the burden was on the United States to rectify a history of hostilities toward Cuba. ""The U.S. government... invaded Cuba, put the blockade [embargo] in place, imposed restrictive measures,"" he told the party leaders. ""Cuba did not do any of that, so in return for nothing they have to solve those asymmetries if they want relations and if they want normalization of the relations. We do not have to give anything in return."" Diaz-Canel, who has an engineering background, characterized President Barack Obamas efforts to normalize relations with Cuba as an underhanded way of upending the Castro government and mounting ""the destruction of the revolution."" He said he had been directly involved in government efforts to stifle dissidents, and accused some of Cubas most well-known anti-government activists, such as blogger Yoani Sanchez and the Ladies in White, of being subsidized puppets of the United States. ""I always tell the comrades... with whom I work together in this whole confrontation with the counterrevolution: the day we cut the money, the counterrevolution ends,"" said Diaz-Canel, a tall, white-haired man with a baritone voice who favors buttoned-down shirts and suits to the military fatigues that the Castro brothers usually wore. U.S. State Department officials told Fox News the agency expects no change in Cubas oppressive government after Castro steps down. ""We would prefer not to speculate ahead of the selection of the next president,"" a State Department official told Fox News. ""However, on March 11, Cubas Communist Party presented voters with a pre-determined slate of 605 candidates for the 605 National Assembly seats."" ""The exercise was essentially a rubber stamp of Communist Party-determined appointments to the body that will select Cubas next president,"" the official said. ""The Cuban government blocked independent candidates from getting their names on the ballot. Cuban citizens had no real or meaningful choice during this tightly-controlled electoral process, which does not meet the most basic definition of democracy or freedom."" Many Cuba watchers say that Raul Castro will continue to wield enormous influence given that despite stepping down from the presidency, he will remain as General Secretary of the Community Party. If Diaz-Canel succeeds him, it will be because Castro chose him, experts say. ""Diaz-Canel is the designated 'civilian face of the military dictatorship,"" said Otto Reich, former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs under President George W. Bush. ""We must remember the real power in Cuba will continue to be the Castro family dynasty. Even after 'resigning, Raul will remain Secretary General of the Communist Party, the most important position in the government...Rauls son, Colonel Alejandro Castro Espin, will remain in charge of counterintelligence (the political police) and therefore the chief enforcer of order, ideology, and loyalty to the dynasty."" Other Castro family members will continue in key positions of government and the military, which owns nearly three-quarters of ""the productive sector of the economy, including all tourist infrastructure,"" Reich told Fox News. ""Nothing will change in Cuba until the West stops playing the regimes game."" Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, agrees. ""We must be clear-eyed as we examine the future of Cuba,"" Menendez said to Fox News. ""Raul Castros hand-picked successor has no plans to release political prisoners, stop harboring fugitives and foreign terrorists, respect free speech or to finally grant basic liberties to Cubans."" """"Unless the regime commits to governing Cuba rather than exploiting its people, this transition wont be any different for Cubans."" Cubas next president would grapple with an economy in crisis, notably because it can no longer depend on Venezuela, which is experiencing its own economic as well as political turmoil. Theres also technological advances that the Cuban government has seen as an evil necessity, trying to adapt to them while also fighting to control the new avenues they have given dissidents wanting to tell the world - in real time - about regime crackdowns on protesters. Diaz-Canel has told party leaders that government agencies need to use technology to disseminate information - and tenets of the Communist revolution -- to a younger generation on the island that increasingly turns to social media. He also said that Cubans should be able to use the Internet and social media to interact with the government, even ""to criticize."" Most Cubans, however, lack easy access to computers and the Internet. They must visit Internet cafes to get access. Unclear, of course, is what changes will occur, under Diaz-Canel or someone else, once Raul Castro no longer has the same influence on the government. Raul Castro presided over some key reforms that included allowing Cubans to run their own businesses, entering the agreement with Obama to restore diplomatic relations, and allowing some of Cuba's most prominent dissidents to travel abroad -- where they often denounced him and human rights violations on the island -- and return home. While Raul Castro did these things, which Fidel was loathe to do, he often pulled back, maintaining an iron first on dissidents -- who routinely were arrested and detained -- and he criticized Obama shortly after hosting the U.S. president during the historic 2016 visit to Havana. John Gronbeck-Tedesco, a professor at Ramapo College in New Jersey and author of books about Cuba, said the impact that a Diaz-Canel government could have cannot be predicted at this point. ""What Diaz-Canel does or doesn't do will depend on how Cubans respond to the first non-Castro leader in three generations,"" Gronbeck-Tedesco told Fox News. ""The key unknown, it seems to me, is how young people will respond to the change in leadership."" ""Undoubtedly, Diaz-Canel will have to address them as a key constituency, which the Castros were able to overlook due to the history of the revolution,"" he said, ""but now young Cubans have expectations after having had their voices silenced or ignored for many years. Diaz-Canel may have to confront this oversight early in his leadership.""",
"Miguel Diaz-Canel is the new president of Cuba, succeeding Raul Castro",https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/americas/cuba-end-of-castro-era/index.html,04/18/18,www.cnn.com,"Correction: A previous version of this article gave the incorrect year of Elian Gonzalez's discovery off the Florida coast. He was found in 1999. Havana, Cuba CNN -- For the first time in the lives of most Cubans, a man not named Castro will lead the Communist-run island nation. Cubas National Assembly announced Thursday that First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 57, will replace Raul Castro as the head of the Cuban government. Castro embraced Diaz-Canel - who wasnt even born when Fidel Castro led his revolution in 1959 - during the session Wednesday, all but sealing his status as the islands next president. That session also included the vote for the new leader, which was 603-1 in favor of Diaz-Canel.

Although he will remain as the powerful first secretary of the Communist Party in Cuba, Castro says it is time for the next generation of supporters of the Cuban revolution to take power. Prev Next Heirs apparent? For years, many Cubans speculated that Raul Castros daughter Mariela - a member of the National Assembly and advocate for gay and transgender rights - or his son, Alejandro - a colonel in Cuban counterintelligence who represented the island in secret talks with the United States - would be the next Castros to take power. Fidel Castros son commits suicide Instead, legislators selected Diaz-Canel, who had promised to hew closely to the course set by the Castro brothers. ""I believe in continuity,"" Diaz-Canel told reporters recently when asked about his vision for Cubas future. ""I think there always will be continuity."" ""Continuity"" most likely means continued restrictions on the private sector for Cubans, tight controls on foreign investment and no openings to the single-party political system. Before becoming the heir apparent to Raul Castro, when Diaz-Canel was still climbing his way up the ranks of the Communist Party hierarchy in the islands provinces, he earned a nickname that stuck with him: ""Dia y Noche"" or Day and Night. The moniker came from low-level government employees who found out the hard way that at any hour Diaz-Canel could show up unannounced to inspect whether workers were actually on the job and not pilfering supplies or taking a nap. That fastidiousness and willingness to work around the clock may be key assets in Diaz-Canels new position as president. Will a new leader make a difference? Few people expect much to change in the only Communist-run country in the Western Hemisphere, at least not right away. Now 24 and a supporter of the Cuban revolution, Elian Gonzalez says Cuba will remain the same after Raul Castro steps down as president. Patrick Oppmann/CNN ""Cuba will keep being Cuba, no one can change it,"" Elian Gonzalez, the boy found on an inner tube off the Florida coast in 1999, told CNN. Gonzalez, then 5 years old, was placed with relatives in Miami but returned to Cuba with his father following a court battle. He was seen frequently with Fidel Castro, whom he described as being like a father to him. Video Ad Feedback 03:45 - Source: CNN A look Fidel Castro's life (2016) Now Gonzalez, 24, has emerged as one of the most effective advocates for the revolution and many Cubans believe he will one day have a leadership role. ""Cuba wont change if another administration comes, if another president comes,"" he said. Cuban leaders say they are ""perfecting"" their revolution while resisting external pressures to open the economy and political system. Castro will remain a powerful figure Even though Raul Castro, according to Cuban government officials, plans to move to Santiago de Cuba, the city where his brother Fidel was buried, he will still exercise a large measure of control over the Cuban government and have the final say on important decisions. ""Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, will lead the decisions of greatest transcendence for the present and the future of this country,"" Diaz-Canel said in a speech to the Cuban National Assembly in Havana on Thursday. This week marks the anniversary of the Cuban government victory over CIA-trained Cuban exile forces at the Bay of Pigs, a highly symbolic moment for Castro to step down and for his replacement to be chosen in the secret vote by the National Assembly. Stacked with members of the Cuban Communist Party, the only political party allowed on the island, and fervent supporters of the revolution, the National Assembly nearly always votes unanimously for the proposals made by the top Cuban leadership. Despite their efforts to join the National Assembly, government opponents have either lost or not been allowed by the government on the ballot in municipal elections. A revolutionary leader Even as Cubas economy struggles and officials tweak the islands economic model with little apparent success, there was no transformational leader waiting in the wings. ""You see it on signs everywhere here, 'Fidel is Cuba,"" said Vicki Huddleston, the former head of the US diplomatic mission in Havana. ""You wont be seeing signs that say 'Raul is Cuba. He was a placeholder. The next head of Cuba will be a placeholder. There is no charismatic leader like Fidel was."" For opponents of the Cuban revolution who expected support for the government to crumble when Fidel Castro died, a peaceful transfer of power could indicate they have even longer to wait for change to occur.

Tall and gray-haired, with the physique of a former body builder who no longer hits the gym that often, Diaz-Canel speaks in a soft monotone and rarely strays too far from the script in public appearances. But while there were other, more dynamic members of his generation who years earlier appeared to have a better lock on the top job, Diaz-Canel quietly made a name for himself as an efficient administrator while serving as the top Communist Party official for the provinces of Villa Clara and then Holguin, where Fidel and Raul Castro were born.

EFE/Alejandro Ernesto/POOL 'We are defending our revolution When Cubans went to the polls in March to vote in single-party, single-candidate elections for the Cuban National Assembly, the international press in Cuba was encouraged by government officials to cover Diaz-Canel as he voted in his hometown of Santa Clara.

It also appears unlikely that Diaz-Canel, who served briefly in the army, will be the top general of the islands army, which oversees large swathes of the Cuban economy. Without his own power base or credentials from fighting in the revolution and subsequent conflicts, Diaz-Canel will have to prove himself as a leader who can bridge the divisions within the Cuban government ""He wants consensus,"" said former Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray. ""He is not the kind of guy like Fidel Castro used to be, who imposed consensus."" Will Cuba-US relations change? US officials are waiting to see what changes Diaz-Canel will bring to the job. The transition is taking place just as the US reduced staffing at the US Embassy in Havana to the lowest levels in 40 years, following mystery health incidents involving US diplomats. And the US-Cuba relationship has again chilled after President Donald Trump said he was ""tearing up"" former President Barack Obamas deal with the island and imposed further economic sanctions against the Cuban government. Now, the US government has less contact and influence with Cuba - just as US officials are trying to get a sense of what kind of leader Diaz-Canel will be and how much turnover will take place in the upper ranks of the Cuban government. ""(Diaz-Canel) was not particularly involved in the US relationship,"" said Ben Rhodes, Obamas deputy adviser for national security, who led the US delegation in secret talks with Cuba to re-establish relations. ""Its not just the person at the top, theres all manner of positions that are going to turn over,"" Rhodes said. ""My concern is that what Trump did is that it was the worst possible timing to empower hardliners in that transition who can now say, 'See, we cant count on the US."" And despite reportedly having a love for American rock and roll music, Diaz-Canel has increasingly shown himself to be a hardliner when dealing with the US. ""Sometimes its inexplicable that a country so big, so powerful, has dedicated so much time, resources, evil and perversity to destroying the revolutionary process,"" Diaz-Canel said in 2017, as he attended the opening of a museum in Havana showcasing the CIAs plots against the Cuban government. Challenges at home The frayed US-Cuban relationship will only be one item on the agenda for the next president of Cuba. A worsening economic crisis in Cubas key ally, Venezuela, has disrupted vital oil shipments to the island. And Cuban officials apparently still cannot work out a solution to unifying the islands two currencies, which has hobbled the already faltering economy. Free-market reforms initiated by Raul Castro that allowed thousands of Cubans to go into the private sector have been rolled back after officials complained of a rise in wealth disparity and corruption. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities and low wages, young Cubans are still moving away from Cuba. All those problems and more await Cubas new leadership. ""It must be a very difficult thing to be the president of Cuba,"" said Vicki Huddleston, a former head of the US diplomatic mission in Cuba. ""You have a bureaucracy full of great people who are afraid to do anything. Its a top-down situation. Everything has to come back to you.""",
U.S.-Cuba Bilateral Commission to meet for first time since U.S. withdrew embassy personnel,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/u-s-cuba-bilateral-commission-meets-first-time-u-s-n882561,06/13/18,www.nbcnews.com,"The first round of bilateral meetings between the U.S. and Cuba since Washington permanently withdrew personnel from the embassy in Havana will take place on Thursday in Washington, DC. For some, it will take heightened significance with the backdrop of the recent historic meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, where Kim agreed to denuclearize in exchange for better relations with the U.S. In the case of Cuba, tensions between the two countries intensified after Trump rolled back on some of former President Barack Obamas historic detente with the island. A draw down in U.S. embassy personnel following mysterious incidents that have affected the health of U.S. diplomats and their families has further strained relations. The Bilateral Commission will be the seventh meeting the two countries have held since restoring relations in 2015. The last meeting was in September 2017 and it was the first time they met under the Trump administration. It took place under different circumstances than the previous meetings. The health incidents had been reported a few weeks prior and Trump had announced a rollback in Obamas policy a few months before. After the meeting, the Cuban Foreign Ministry released a sharply worded statement protesting critical comments made by Trump to the U.N. General Assembly while the Bilateral Commission was in session. Trump had called Cuba ""corrupt and destabilizing"" and said he would not lift the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba until it made ""fundamental reforms."" The Bilateral Commission is the platform through which the U.S. and Cuba identify, prioritize, and schedule initiatives, including specific dialogues and working group meetings. Some of the topics covered are dialogues on human rights, law enforcement, claims, and migration, according to a State Department spokesperson for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. John Creamer, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs will lead the U.S. side. The State Department did not confirm who would be leading the Cuban delegation, but sources familiar with the meeting said it is Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, who has replaced Josefina Vidal as director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry. She was Cubas chief negotiator during the opening toward Cuba and is now the Cuban ambassador to Canada. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment about whether the U.S. would press Cuba about the unexplained health incidents during the meeting. Last week, the U.S. withdrew two more people from the embassy due to health concerns. They are considered potential new cases but have not yet been medically confirmed. If confirmed by doctors at the University of Pennsylvania, where others affected have been treated, they will mark the 25th and 26th confirmed cases in Cuba. The incidents were first disclosed last year. The confirmed patients have a range of symptoms and diagnoses including mild traumatic brain injury and permanent hearing loss. In February, the U.S. made permanent its decision to withdraw 60 percent of its diplomats from Cuba, citing its need to protect American personnel. The U.S. has said it does not know who is behind it, but has argued Cuba is responsible for protecting diplomats on its soil. Cuba has denied any involvement or knowledge of the events. The U.S. and Cuba continue making strides in some areas. Direct mail service was recently reestablished after a trial run. The two countries held three meetings in Washington during February focused on law enforcement issues, according to a State Department spokesperson. One was on money laundering and denying criminals financial safe havens abroad and two were on trafficking persons But Cuba still views the trade embargo on the island as the major obstacle in advancing relations between the two countries and in the development of their stagnant economy. Lifting the embargo still faces domestic opposition in the U.S. According to Daniel Erikson, a former Latin America advisor under the Obama administration, Cuba is more focused on domestic housekeeping than in trying to revitalize their relations with the U.S., ""The opening under Obama kind of exhausted them,"" Erikson said. ""The last thing the new Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, wants to deal with is some kind of bold diplomatic overture from the Trump administration.""

"Cuban diplomats hijack US event on political prisoners, causing chaos at UN",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cuban-diplomats-hijack-us-event-on-political-prisoners-causing-chaos-at-un,10/16/18,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! A U.S.-led event to draw attention to the plight of political prisoners in Cuba under the repressive communist government was hijacked Tuesday by pro-regime diplomats -- who screamed slogans and banged tables in a display an American diplomat called shameful. The event, ""Jailed for What? The plight of Cubas political prisoners,"" featured former political prisoners and human rights activists and took place in the U.N.s Economic and Social Council chamber (ECOSOC). The meeting was led by U.S. ECOSOC Ambassador Kelley Currie. Within moments of her opening statement, diplomats started screaming slogans and banging their hands on tables as part of an effort to derail the event. Diplomats from Cuba and Bolivia -- including Bolivian Ambassador Sacha Llorenti, who is currently the president of the U.N. Security Council for October -- were among those banging on tables. Currie, along with other speakers at the event, continued with their remarks -- choosing instead to raise their voices over the ensuing cacophony. Currie did not stop her speech, instead speaking louder while hailing the bravery of Cuban political prisoners and noting the Trump administration is ""holding the Cuban government responsible for human rights violations."" After the event, Currie told reporters that the protesters were ""most of the Cuban diplomatic mission"" and that the meeting was delayed after the Cuban delegation refused to allow U.N. security to conduct a sweep of the room. ""I have never in my life seen diplomats behave the way the Cuban delegation did today. It was really shocking and disturbing and it makes you wonder that if the diplomats of this government behave this way, how do the police behave?"" she said, adding that the delegation ""should be ashamed of themselves."" Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor who also spoke at the event, thanked the Cuban delegation ""for a demonstration of exactly what we are talking about."" ""You can imagine what its like in Cuba if the government of Cuba behaves like this in the chambers of the United Nations with security present,"" he said. He also refused to close the event until the allotted time was up, even going so far as to taunt the yelling diplomats. ""I can sit here all day and let yourselves shout yourselves silly,"" he said. Miriam Cardet Concepcion, the sister of Eduardo Cardet Concepcion -- who was jailed for three years for criticizing former leader Fidel Castro -- appeared by video after being refused permission to travel by the Cuban regime. Her appearance only emboldened diplomats and protesters, who raised their voices to interrupt her video message. One U.N. employee told Fox News that he had never seen anything like the display in all the years hes been at Turtle Bay. Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, told Fox News that the theatrics were typical of the Cuban regime. ""The Castro regime always creates this kind of scene, even here at the United Nations,"" he said. ""It doesnt reflect the Cuban people or the Cuban nation as a whole, just the regime."" The Cuban Mission released a lengthy statement blasting the event as ""a political comedy staged on false arguments and with supporting actors of a dark history at the service of a foreign power."" It said that Cuba had requested the event be canceled.

Diplomatic showdown at the UN as Cuba interrupt US meeting,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/16/us/united-nations-cuba-interrupts-us-meeting/index.html,10/16/18,www.cnn.com,"CNN -- This wasnt the ""Missiles of October,"" the famed nuclear showdown between Cuba and the United States in 1962, but tensions between the two countries were impossible to ignore at the United Nations Tuesday afternoon. A US event meant to highlight the plight of Cubas political prisoners was drowned out by the noise of Cuban diplomats banging on tables and voices screaming, ""Cuba yes, blockade no"" across a large conference room, a reference to the US economic embargo against the island nation. Cuban diplomats were using both hands to slap the rectangular table while others were yelling in Spanish, and although US Ambassador Kelley Currie repeatedly asked for security, officers stood watching the protest without intervening. Why? Because the protesters were accredited UN diplomats from Cuba, and yelling diplomats cannot be physically restrained based on UN security protocols. The United States may be considered the most powerful member - financially and diplomatically - at the United Nations, but despite its status, security would not step into the fray. The near 90-minute meeting was met with the sound of dissent by Cuban diplomats, with panelists trying their best not to acknowledge the uproar. ""I was ready to end the proceedings, but Im damned if Im going to do it for you. So I can sit here all day and let you shout yourselves silly,"" Ambassador Michael Kozak told the protesters. Kozak, of the US State Departments Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, moderated a panel after Curries remarks. ""I have never in my life seen diplomats behave in the way the Cuban delegation did today,"" Currie, the US representative on the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, told reporters after leaving the conference room, calling protesters actions ""shocking and disturbing."" ""It makes you wonder that if the diplomats of this government behave this way, how do the police behave?"" The ""thuggish behavior"" displayed by the diplomats has no place at the United Nations, Currie said, adding that the island nation and its diplomatic representatives should be ashamed of themselves. The estimated 130 political prisoners held by the Cuban government are ""an explicit sign of the repressive nature of the regime and represent a blatant affront to the fundamental freedoms that the United States and many other democratic governments support,"" the State Department said in a statement describing the event. ""Holding the Cuban regime responsible for its human rights violations and supporting the Cuban peoples aspirations to live in freedom are key components of President Trumps National Security Presidential Memorandum of 2017."" Cuba forcefully objected to this meeting being called by the United States, appealing in vain in recent days to the United Nations, and writing a letter to the UN secretary-general. The ""Jailed for What?"" event was an attempt by the United States to hoodwink the international community into ignoring its own human rights violations at home and abroad, a statement released by the Cuban Mission to the United Nations said. The United States has a ""pattern of systematic violations of all human rights,"" it said, citing torture of Guantanamo detainees, the murder of African-Americans at the hands of police officers, and imprisonment of immigrants. The secretary-general of the Organization of American States, a former political prisoner, and the sister of a current political prisoner in Cuba comprised an expert panel in the meeting. But of all the words exchanged, the ambassador may be the only person who may want to retract her opening comments. ""Thank you for coming,"" Currie said, welcoming everyone to the event.",

EXCLUSIVE -- U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley is demanding the U.N. Secretary General take action against the Bolivian and Cuban delegations after they disrupted a U.S. event to draw attention to the plight of political prisoners in Cuba -- damaging U.N. property in the process. The event on Tuesday, ""Jailed for What? The plight of Cubas political prisoners,"" which took place in the U.N.s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) chamber, descended into chaos when diplomats from the two countries -- including Bolivian Ambassador Sacha Llorenti -- started banging on tables and screaming slogans in an effort to derail the event. Speakers, including former prisoners and relatives of those currently imprisoned under the communist regime, struggled to be heard over the noise. In a letter to Secretary General Antonio Guterres, sent Friday and obtained by Fox News, Haley said the behavior by the Cuban and Bolivian diplomats was ""outrageous"" and called for action from Guterres. CUBAN DIPLOMATS HIJACK US EVENT ON POLITICAL PRISONERS, CAUSING CHAOS AT UN ""Due to the outrageous behavior of the Cuban and Bolivian U.N. delegations, this diplomatic event became a mob scene, and resulted in significant damage to U.N. property,"" the letter says. ""I respectfully call on you to condemn this extremely unprofessional conduct and require the Cuban and Bolivian delegations to pay for the property damage they caused."" Haley said that the U.N. initially said the U.S would be contacted to pay for the damage to desks and earphones, but U.N. officials eventually said that the U.N. itself would bear the cost. Haley called this ""completely unacceptable"" considering the U.S. is the largest contributor to the U.N. budget, and pays 22 percent of the budget -- and therefore of any repair cost as well. Instead, Haley demanded that the Bolivian and Cuban delegations be made to bear the cost. In a statement to Fox News, Haley was no less scathing in her assessment of the behavior by the delegations. ""Cubas UN delegation destroyed property with their juvenile, unprofessional behavior that was a mockery of diplomacy,"" she said. ""Theres no way the U.N. should pay for those repairs - with U.S. taxpayers footing 22 percent of that bill. The bill needs to be sent directly to Cuba."" The Cuban Mission has already demanded an investigation into how the event was allowed to take place, having called it ""a political comedy staged on false arguments and with supporting actors of a dark history at the service of a foreign power."" ""It is part of the actions aimed at subverting the legitimately established constitutional order and of the interventionist agenda that has gained renewed momentum under the current administration, whose fascist, racist and xenophobic ideas are a matter of grave concern in the international community,"" the statement said. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres, told Fox News Tuesday that missions must certify that public meetings are consistent with the purposes and principles of the U.N. and that they are non-commercial in nature. He said the U.S. had done so with regards to Tuesday's event. He also said that it is not the role of U.N. security to remove disruptive delegates unless they pose a physical threat. Haley welcomed the Cuban call for an investigation and said that the the U.N. should also investigate the damage and the misconduct by the Cuban and Bolivian delegations -- include removing access to the U.N. for those responsible. ""This conduct was an assault on the dignity, ideals and fundamental purposes of the U.N."" she said. Dujarric told Fox News that the Secretary Generals office had received the letter and was looking into it. The Bolivian and Cuban missions did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The event on Tuesday still went ahead, with speakers yelling over the protesters, but the U.S. said the event was delayed after the Cuban delegation refused to allow security to conduct a sweep of the chamber. ""I have never in my life seen diplomats behave the way the Cuban delegation did today. It was really shocking and disturbing and it makes you wonder that if the diplomats of this government behave this way, how do the police behave?""

"Cuba Blames Trump for Bread, Flour, Meat Shortages Before New Year",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2018/12/17/cuba-blames-trump-food-shortages/,12/17/18,www.breitbart.com,"Cubas second-in-command, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, issued remarks Sunday blaming ""the impact of the embargo, which has strengthened under the Trump administration,"" for nationwide shortages of bread, eggs, and other basic goods as Cubans prepare to celebrate the new year and the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. The official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, Granma, quoted Miguel Diaz-Canel speaking at the debut of the nations 2019 economic plan, which the publication branded ""objective and realist."" ""The people expect an economic response that impacts their day-to-day lives, that is why the majority of our time must be directed towards this battle,"" Diaz-Canel is quoted as stating, adding that Cubans must ""overcome little bits of every problem every day."" The Cuban president, who is subordinate to Communist Party leader and Commander-in-Chief Raul Castro, acknowledged that Cuba failed to achieve the objectives of the 2018 economic plan but blamed the ""complex economic situation we face."" Among the challenges he reportedly listed were ""structural problems and insufficiencies ... but we cannot underestimate the impact of the embargo."" Granma claims that, under U.S. President Donald Trump, ""financial persecution"" of the Cuban regime has increased. The White House has pivoted away from policies under his predecessor Barack Obama that greatly enriched military-owned Cuban corporate entities, money that Havana funneled into the persecution of pro-democracy dissidents. Diaz-Canels excuses for the failed economic objectives proposed during his first year as ceremonial figurehead of the Castro regime follow a week in which Cubans have grown increasingly impatient with significant food shortages across the island. Cuba had anticipated a 30,000-ton flour deficit for the year and attempted to prepare for such a situation. Instead, Cubas deficit rose to 70,000 tons, leaving the country without 40,000 tons necessary to feed the country. Government officials have explained in state media outlets that the reason for the shortage is mechanical damage in much of the nations wheat mills in eastern and central Cuba, the nations agricultural centers. The Castro regime claims it cannot access the replacement pieces necessary to make the mills run. The lack of wheat flour has triggered a nationwide bread shortage. Cubans typically have access to two types of bread: small, low-quality buns that are unrationed, and edible loaves of bread that each familys ration book limits the purchase of depending on family size. Many refuse the smaller bread, calling it inedible, which has resulted in extensive, hours-long lines at the few bakeries in the country still able to offer bread loaves. The Spain-based Diario de Cuba reported on Monday that bakeries are not the only food vendors affected. In addition to bread, Cubans are struggling to find crackers, pizza, and pastries, which are typically popular for the end of year holiday. Pizzerias in Havana have been forced to keep very short hours or shut down entirely. The few who remain open tell the newspaper, ""we have been buying on the side [illegally] more than ever."" The traditional Cuban flour cracker can cost as much as $1 each, or 25 Cuban pesos. The government pays doctors a salary of 64 pesos, or nearly three crackers, a month. Cubanet, a dissident outlet with reporters in Cuba and the United States, reported that conversations with vendors and administrators on background suggest that the shortages are not only due to the lack of production in Cuba, but months of prioritizing stocking Cubas lavish hotels and feeding high-ranking Communist Party officials over providing food for the general public, as well as black market trade. Bakers keep a significant number of bread loaves out of Cubas communist ration system and sell them on the black market at much higher rates, many ending up in the hands of well-connected officials. The average Cuban has long endured food shortages, surviving by buying lower-quality alternatives available. Currently, however, many Cubans say they cannot count on any food alternatives arriving at all. One woman who spoke to the outlet CiberCuba, identified as Migdalia Capote, noted that she had not had access to bread, water, eggs, or milk for weeks. ""Long live the 60th anniversary!"" Capote noted sarcastically. The city of Santa Clara in central Cuba has suffered as much or more over these shortages as Havana. There, CiberCuba notes, water shortages have become so acute that many residents have taken to accumulating and drinking rainwater, a dangerous option giving the growing rates of Dengue fever. In Santa Clara, officials have offered the same excuse for the lack of water as they have for the lack of flour nationwide: the local aqueduct is broken and the government has no access to replacement parts. Animal meat remains a scarcity nationwide. Diario de Cuba estimates that the few stores that sell pork offer it at 50-60 Cuban pesos a pound. The shortages recall the early days of dictator Nicolas Maduros regime in Venezuela, shortly following the death of Hugo Chavez in 2013. By then, Chavez had diverted so much of Venezuelas oil reserves into subsidizing the Cuban regime that Venezuela had announced a toilet paper shortage and immediate plans to import food, despite possessing the worlds largest known oil reserves at the time. While Cubans did not see much of this largess - long lines for basic food items have long been a staple of the Cuban Revolution - Cubans have traditionally not faced the near-famine conditions currently occurring in Venezuela. Venezuela implemented a ration card in 2014 following the near complete lack of access to flour, milk, pork, butter, and other basic items. The ration system did not work to improve conditions, leading to a violent political crackdown on protesters and individuals who took photos of empty shelves in supermarkets. A year later, ration lines had grown to such a length that some Venezuelans became professional line-standers, available to wait on a line for a client at a fee. Venezuela officially announced it had run out of food in 2016. Since then, an exodus nearing the millions in number has departed the country, flooding neighboring regions, and shortages have become so acute that the average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds in the past year.

"More Cuban-Americans reverse support for ending embargo, poll says",https://www.foxnews.com/us/frustration-over-lack-of-democratic-reform-in-cuba-fuels-growing-support-for-u-s-trade-embargo-among-south-florida-cuban-americans-poll,01/11/19,www.foxnews.com,"In a reversal of a years-long decline in support for the U.S.-Cuba trade embargo among South Florida Cuban-Americans, a new poll shows more now agree with the restrictive policy that was eased by the Obama administration, but remains in place. The poll, conducted by Florida International University, was evenly split between the 45 percent who said the U.S. should keep the embargo, the 44 who want it to end, and the 11 percent who said they were unsure. That's almost a 10-point change from the poll that roughly two years ago found 54 percent wanted the U.S. to end the embargo - and showed more optimism about the prospect of improved U.S.-Cuba relations. An overwhelming 80 percent of the 1,001 Cuban-American respondents viewed the embargo as a failure, which has not wrung enough democratic reforms from the Cuban government. But the change in the amount who support the embargo seemed to reflect a frustration with the lack of progress in Cuba since the sanctions were eased in recent years. President Barack Obama announced a restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014, and loosened travel and trade restrictions. In 2016, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge, in 1928. Younger Cuban-Americans, including those from the second and third generations, expressed the most opposition to the embargo. Cuban Americans who came to the U.S. after 1995 also viewed the embargo more negatively than others. But it was among older Cuban-Americans that support for the embargo jumped more than 10 points - from 57 to 68 percent - in the latest poll. And more than half of Cuban-Americans who are registered voters agree with maintaining the embargo. At the same time, 63 percent said they supported Obamas decision to open diplomatic relations with Cuba. ""The mood of the community has changed in the last two years, said Guillermo Grenier, the principal investigator on the project, and chairman of the Department of Global and Sociocultural Studies in the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs, the primary sponsor of the poll. ""We see a community divided on the issue of the embargo, while still willing to maintain and even expand business relationships established as a result of the Obama initiatives."" ""Cuban-Americans continue to welcome and support many of the changes in U.S. policy since December 2014, such as travel, the maintenance or expansion of limited economic relations and the willingness to allow U.S. citizens to invest in Cuban businesses,"" the poll authors wrote. ""Yet, there is a retrenchment of old, less conciliatory positions by the old, less conciliatory segments of the community."" The embargo long has been described as symbolic by both its supporters and critics, who view it as a solitary move in a world that keeps diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba. The new poll results explain why many Cuban Americans support the embargo, even as they concede it has not pushed real change in Cuba. Dulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights, told Fox News: ""The survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression. The reaction among these Cuban Americans is a natural one toward the Cuban regimes intolerance and inflexibility."" Cuba each year urges the U.N. General Assembly to pass a resolution critical of the embargo, a text that normally obtains majority backing. According to Cuba, the U.S. embargo has cost the island more than $800 billion since it was was implemented in 1962. Succeeding U.S. presidential administrations and many members of Congress have said the embargo will not be lifted until Cuba moves toward more democratic reforms, like legitimate elections and freedom of expression. During his presidential campaign, and as president, Donald Trump said Obamas decision to ease trade and travel restrictions essentially played into the hands of a regime that had made virtually no concessions in return. Cuban government officials typically deny the existence of political prisoners, saying instead that counter-revolutionary activities, or trying to incite others against the regime, is a crime. Obama earned praise by moving forward with normalizing relations, particularly among those who said it was time to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations. But others said Obama gave away too much, and got back little or nothing in return. And not only did Obama's actions not benefit the U.S., the critics said, they did nothing to help the Cuban people. The survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression -- Dulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights Cuba's new president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, who took over last year from Raul Castro, who in turn succeeded his brother Fidel 2008, was the hand-picked successor of Cuba's leadership. And while some significant changes did take place under Raul Castro, including more access to the Internet by critics of the government, and the chance for Cubans to run their own businesses. Travel outside the island became less restrictive, and some of the governments most vocal critics, including Guillermo Farinas and Yoani Sanchez, were allowed to travel abroad - where they firmly assailed the islands political leaders in speeches and media interviews -- and return to Cuba. Many of those moves did not occur under Fidel Castros leadership. But much has not changed. Political opposition is discouraged and often punished, with threats of job loss and imprisonment. Dissidents still report incidents of beatings and arrests for participating in peaceful marches or expressing opposition. ""If the polling is an accurate portrait, likely an 'exasperation factor contributed to the increase in those supporting the 'embargo,"" said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc., in New York. ""From December, 2014 through November, 2016, there was an expectation, perhaps more of a rational hope, that the Obama administration changes to the bilateral commercial, economic and political relationship with the Republic of Cuba would continue through [a Hillary] Clinton administration. That was faulty thinking because of the outcome of the election."" ""There was also an expectation, and, again, rational hope, that changes taking place in the Republic of Cuba would continue but, more importantly, would increase in velocity,"" Kavulich said to Fox News. ""The transition from the Castro administration to the Diaz-Canel administration would bring a new dynamic."" But the result has been ""a continuing struggle by the government of the Republic of Cuba in determining the definition of success and the level of success permitted for a citizen,"" he said. ""Finally, there has been a disappointment by individuals of Cuban descent who reside in Florida with the abject lack of Obama Administration initiatives permitted to be implemented by the government of the Republic of Cuba."" ?",
Trump administration OKs lawsuits against Cuba for property seized during revolution,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-lawsuits-on-cuba-property-seized,03/04/19,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The State Department on Monday announced it would allow lawsuits to be brought against Cuba companies and individuals by people whose property was seized by the communist government during and after Fidel Castro's revolution in the late 1950s. In the United States' latest move to punish Cuba and encourage democracy in the communist nation, the State Department announced it would suspend for 30 days part of the 1996 Libertad Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act, and allow some lawsuits to be brought against companies using properties confiscated by the Cuban government after its 1959 revolution. ""Even under a new president in Cuba, nothing has changed,"" a senior State Department official said Monday. ""The U.S. is holding the Cuban regime responsible."" CUBAN GUARDS SURROUNDING MADURO, US MILITARY COMMANDER SAYS Every president since Bill Clinton has suspended the section of the act that would allow such lawsuits because they could snarl companies from U.S.-allied countries - like the United Kingdom, France and Spain - in years of complicated litigation that could prompt international trade claims against the United States. The State Department, however, made clear that any lawsuits brought in U.S. federal courts would target Cuban entities and sub-entities, not ones owned or controlled by U.S. allies. Allowing a limited number of lawsuits could make investment in Cuba more burdensome for companies thinking of entering the market, who will now have to do additional research into their legal liability, but it is unlikely to be a major blow against the Cuban economy. ""This is the first time we're not fully suspending this section of the Libertad Act,"" the senior State Department official said. ""We're giving claimants the opportunity to sue for their property."" While State Department officials said the move was focused on advancing the cause of individual rights in Cuba, other officials also linked the actions to Havana's role in supporting the regime of disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. CUBA CITES LACK OF EVIDENCE IN MYSTERIOUS SONIC ATTACKS ON DIPLOMATS In a tweet on Monday, National Security Adviser John Bolton blamed Cuba for its role in ""fomenting repression in Venezuela"" and said the U.S. would be tightening financial restrictions. ""Cubas role in usurping democracy and fomenting repression in Venezuela is clear,"" Bolton tweeted. ""Thats why the U.S. will continue to tighten financial restrictions on Cubas military and intel services. The regions democracies should condemn the Cuba regime."" Caracas and other parts of the South American nation continue to be plagued by widespread shortages of basic supplies and political unrest. On Friday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on six high-ranking members of the Venezuelan security forces and revoked the visas of other officials and their relatives in the latest effort to pressure Maduro to relinquish power. The sanctions are in response to the blocking of humanitarian aid convoys last week while the visa revocations on dozens of individuals are intended to punish people who have flourished amid the South American country's dire economic crisis, Elliott Abrams, the special representative for Venezuela, told reporters. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maduro's forces fired tear gas and buckshot at activists trying to deliver humanitarian aid in violent clashes on Feb. 23, leaving two people dead and about 300 injured. ""Maduro supporters that abuse or violate human rights, steal from the Venezuelan people or undermine Venezuela's democracy are not welcome in the United States,"" Abrams said. ""Neither are their family members who enjoy a privileged lifestyle at the expense of the liberty and prosperity of millions of Venezuelans."" Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido arrived back in the country on Monday as hundreds of protestors gathered in a Caracas plaza, heeding a call from the self-declared interim president to turn out for his expected return to Venezuela. Dozens of countries - including the U.S. - have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, arguing that last year's re-election of Maduro was invalid. Guaido returned from a tour of several Latin American nation where he was hoping to drum up support among regional leaders for his claim to leadership in Venezuela. After nearly 60 years of a trade embargo, meanwhile, the Cuban economy is in a period of consistently low growth of about 1 percent a year, with foreign investment at roughly $2 billion. But tourism, remittances and subsidized oil from Venezuela have allowed the government to maintain basic services. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
"To Pressure Cuba, Trump Plans to Lift Limits on American Lawsuits",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-cuba-lawsuits.html,04/16/19,www.nytimes.com,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has approved a move intended to further choke off foreign investment in Cuba by lifting longstanding limits on American citizens seeking to sue over property confiscated by the Havana government going back to Fidel Castros revolution six decades ago, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. The decision, a sharp departure from the policy of the last three presidents, could open the floodgates to thousands of lawsuits against foreign companies and individuals accused of ""trafficking"" in seized property. By doing so, Mr. Trump hopes to raise the pressure on Cuba, but risks another rupture with American allies in Europe and Canada that scrambled in vain in recent days to head off the change. The action will be announced by the State Department on Wednesday and discussed by the presidents national security adviser, John R. Bolton, in a speech in Miami marking the 58th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs operation that failed to topple the Castro government during the early days of John F. Kennedys administration. Mr. Trump is trying to force Havana to back off its support for Venezuelas leader, Nicolas Maduro, whom administration officials said Cuba had propped up with more than 20,000 troops. In his decision to lift the limits, Mr. Trump brushed aside vigorous protests by European leaders who brought their objections to Washington in recent weeks. Spains foreign minister met with Mr. Bolton, and other European officials pressed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, arguing that such a move would harm their businesses as well as the Cuban people.",
Trump will allow lawsuits over U.S. properties seized in Cuba,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-will-allow-lawsuits-over-u-s-properties-seized-cuba-n995186,04/16/19,www.nbcnews.com,"Stepping up pressure on Cuba, the Trump administration will allow lawsuits against foreign companies doing business in properties seized from Americans after the islands 1959 revolution, a senior administration official said Tuesday. The move marks a change in more than two decades of U.S. policy on Cuba. President Donald Trump has been taking steps to isolate embattled Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro, who is clinging to power with help from other countries, including Cuba, China and Russia. The new policy against Havana could deal a severe blow to Cubas efforts to draw foreign investment, and spawn international trade disputes between the U.S. and Europe. The 1996 Helms-Burton Act gave Americans the right to sue the mostly European companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties that Cuba nationalized after Fidel Castro took power. The act even allows lawsuits by Cubans who became U.S. citizens years after their properties were taken. Canada, France, Spain, Great Britain and other countries with large investments in Cuba have ferociously protested the law and threatened to sue in the World Trade Organization if Washington tries to interfere with the business ties between Cuba and another sovereign nation. U.S. airlines and cruise lines that bring hundreds of thousands of travelers to Cuba each year appear to be exempted. Every U.S. president since Bill Clinton has suspended the key clause to avoid those trade clashes and a potential mass of lawsuits that would prevent any future settlement with Cuba over nationalized properties. Cuba has said it is willing to reimburse the owners of confiscated properties, but only if the communist government is also reimbursed for billions of dollars in damages generated by the six-decade U.S. trade embargo. The announcement comes at a moment of severe economic weakness for Cuba, which is struggling to find enough cash to import basic food and other supplies following a drop in aid from Venezuela, and a string of bad years in other key economic sectors. Foreign investment in Cuba increased slightly in recent years, but it remains far below the levels needed to recapitalize the islands dilapidated, often collapsing infrastructure. The Trump administrations decision is not expected to drive out major foreign players like Pernod-Ricard of France, which makes Havana Club rum, or Spanish hotel chains Melia or Iberostar, but it could prove a major obstacle to new investment from foreign companies. National security adviser John Bolton is expected to discuss the new policy during a speech Wednesday in Miami, which is home to thousands of exiles and immigrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. The speech at the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association is to be delivered on the 58th anniversary of the United States failed 1961 invasion of the island, an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government. Speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement, the Trump administration official said there will be no more waivers to the key piece of Helms-Burton, known as Title III. The official said the administration also plans to start enforcing the section of the act that allows the U.S. to deny entry visas to Cubans and citizens of other countries involved in trafficking in the confiscated property.

Trump to allow lawsuits over US properties seized in Cuba,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-suits-us-properties-seized-cuba-62434445,04/16/19,abcnews.go.com,"The Trump administration is poised to step up pressure on Cuba by allowing lawsuits against foreign companies doing business in properties seized from Americans after the island's 1959 revolution WASHINGTON -- Stepping up pressure on Cuba, the Trump administration will allow lawsuits against foreign companies doing business in properties seized from Americans after the islands 1959 revolution, a senior administration official said Tuesday.

Johana Tablada, Cubas deputy director of U.S. affairs, said on Twitter: Before they try to euphorically ride a wave of wickedness and lies, they should take a dose of reality. The world has told John Bolton and the U.S. government to eliminate the criminal blockade against Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act. The 1996 act gave Americans the right to sue the mostly European companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties that Cuba nationalized after Fidel Castro took power.

Canada, France, Spain, Great Britain and other countries with large investments in Cuba have ferociously protested the law and threatened to sue in the World Trade Organization if Washington tries to interfere with the business ties between Cuba and another sovereign nation. The extraterritorial application of the U.S. embargo is illegal and violates international law, said Alberto Navarro, the European Union ambassador to Cuba. I personally consider it immoral. For 60 years the only thing thats resulted from the embargo is the suffering of the Cuban people. U.S. airlines and cruise lines that bring hundreds of thousands of travelers to Cuba each year appear to be exempt from the key provision of the Helms-Burton Act.

It will harm prospective investment in Cuba. It will not cause people who are invested in Cuba already to pull out now, said Phil Peters, director of the Arlington, Virginia-based Cuba Research Center, who advocated for closer relations with Cuba and has consulted for U.S. companies looking to invest. Peters said he also believed the new measure could hurt the Trump administrations effort to force Maduro from power with help from allies like Spain. There are plenty of countries that are interested in helping Venezuela find a soft landing after Maduro, but they are not interested in waging an economic war on Cuba, Peters said. The U.S. official said the administration also plans to start enforcing the section of the act that allows the U.S. to deny entry visas to Cubans and citizens of other countries involved in trafficking in the confiscated property.

Trump expected to become first President to target Cuba with this controversial policy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/politics/us-cuba-title-iii-venezuela/index.html,04/16/19,www.cnn.com,"Washington CNN -- The Trump administration is expected to announce its plan to enforce a controversial provision of the decades-old trade embargo on Cuba Wednesday, a senior administration official tells CNN - a decision that will break with the precedent set by every President since Bill Clinton. US National Security Adviser John Bolton is set to outline President Donald Trumps plan to fully implement Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, a previously suspended section of the US trade embargo on the Communist-run country during a speech in Miami, the official said. It is a move that is widely considered to be part of the administrations efforts to ramp up pressure on Havana over its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro - who Trump criticized as a ""Cuban puppet"" in February. Cuban officials have decried the increased sanctions on the communist-run island and offered to enter into negotiations to repay US companies for seized property. During a speech in Miami last year, Bolton promised the crowd a tough US approach to the ""troika of tyranny,"" his term for Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, saying they represented ""the perils of poisonous ideologies left unchecked."" While the decision will likely impact Cubas ability to attract foreign investment, it could also render US, European and Canadian companies vulnerable to legal action. Specifically, Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, also known as the Libertad Act, will permit Cuban Americans and other US citizens to file lawsuits in US federal court against businesses that operate on property the Cuban government appropriated after the 1959 revolution. Title III has never been fully enforced since the law was passed in 1996 as every President since Bill Clinton has waived the provision to avoid trapping companies from US-allied countries in years of complicated litigation, and, in turn, bringing on a wave of trade-related legal claims against the US. Reuters was first to report Boltons planned announcement. In early March, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo chose to partially suspend Title III, allowing US nationals ""the right to bring action against Cuban entities and Cuban sub-entities on the Cuba Restricted List"" for 30 days, a senior State Department official said. Pompeo extended the suspension, with an exception, for two weeks in early April. Ahead of Pompeos March decision, the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council noted that some of the potential targets could include US companies like Delta, Jet Blue, and Marriott. It remains unclear whether the administration has a plan to mitigate the impact on American businesses. The potential implementation of Title III has previously been met with international opposition, particularly from the European Union, which has several member countries with investments in Cuba. While the decision has not yet been announced, it is already making waves with European allies. Last week, the European Unions Federica Mogherini and Cecilia Malmstrom sent a letter to Pompeo, copying Bolton and trade representative Robert Lighthizer, stating their opposition to the move. ""We are writing to respectfully call on the US to adhere to the terms of our agreement and to maintain a full waiver of Title III for EU companies and citizens,"" the letter, dated April 10 and obtained by CNN, says. ""Failing this, the EU will be obliged to use all means at its disposal, including in cooperation with other international partners, to protect its interests."" ""The EU is considering a possible launch of the WTO {World Trade Organization} case,"" the letter states. ""We believe that the issue of outstanding US claims should not be conflated with the cause of furthering democracy and human rights in Cuba, or by our shared desire urgently to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis in Venezuela,"" the two EU officials write. ""We are fully invested to promote both of these objectives, and are convinced that the emergence of protracted judicial proceedings between US claimants and bona fide EU companies will not further them.""",
"Food, medicine shortages hit Cuba, raising fears of new economic crisis",https://nypost.com/2019/04/19/food-medicine-shortages-hit-cuba-raising-fears-of-new-economic-crisis/,04/19/19,nypost.com,"CUBA -- Just after 8 a.m., Pura Castell got in line behind about 100 other people waiting for a chance to buy frozen chicken legs. For two hours she leaned on her cane watching people leave the state-run market with their 5-pound limit. The chicken ran out at 10 a.m. while the 80-year-old Castell still had 20 people in front of her. She returned the next morning, but no chicken. Then, relief. A neighbor told her that chicken had arrived at the government store that distributes heavily subsidized monthly food rations. Her household of three was due three pieces, either thighs or drumsticks. ""Ive taken care of myself my whole life,"" said Castell, a retired janitor. ""I dont just sit on my hands. Im worn out but I walk all over town."" After two decades of relative stability fueled by cheap Venezuelan oil, shortages of food and medicine have once again become a serious daily problem for millions of Cubans. A plunge in aid from Venezuela, the end of a medical services deal with Brazil and poor performances in sectors including nickel mining, sugar and tourism have left the communist state $1.5 billion in debt to the vendors that supply products ranging from frozen chicken to equipment for grinding grain into flour, according to former Economy Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez. Stores no longer routinely stock eggs, flour, chicken, cooking oil, rice, powdered milk and ground turkey, among other products. These basics disappear for days or weeks. Hours-long lines appear within minutes of trucks showing up with new supplies. Shelves are empty again within hours. No one is starving in Cuba, but the shortages are so severe that ordinary Cubans and the countrys leaders are openly referring to the ""special period,"" the years of economic devastation and deep suffering that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cubas Cold War patron. ""Its not about returning to the harshest phase of the special period of the 90s,"" Communist Party head Raul Castro said last week. ""But we always have to be ready for the worst."" Two days later, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said cutbacks were necessary because: ""This harsh moment demands we set clearly defined priorities in order to not return to the worst moments of the special period."" The Trump administration is working hard to push Cuba toward economic crisis. Washington has sanctioned Venezuelas oil industry and the shipping companies that move Venezuelan oil to Cuba. On Wednesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton announced further measures against Cuba and its allies, including a new cap on the amount of money that families in the United States can send their relatives on the island and new restrictions on travel to Cuba. ""The troika of tyranny -- Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua -- is beginning to crumble,"" he said. The move followed the announcement a day earlier that lawsuits would now be permitted against foreign companies doing business in properties seized from Americans after the islands 1959 revolution. The policy could deal a severe blow to Cubas efforts to draw foreign investment. A senior Trump administration official said the economic pressure on Cuba was aimed at forcing the socialist government to stop helping its allies in Venezuela and Nicaragua. The US has accused Cuba of sending soldiers and spies to both countries to strengthen their leaders against protests and potential defection. Cuba denies that. ""Were going to make sure they cannot afford subsidized adventurism, subsidized subversion of democracy outside of their borders,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about US policy toward Cuba. ""At an extraordinarily vulnerable time in their history, theyre going to have to refocus on the domestic needs, their domestic pressures."" Despite some market-oriented reforms over the last decade, Cuba is one of the last countries on Earth to maintain a Soviet-style economy, with most business run by the state. That economy is afflicted by deep inefficiency and corruption. Many state employees demand bribes to provide services to the public. Others spend only a few hours a day at their jobs, spending the rest of their time doing informal private work or selling supplies stolen from their office, warehouse or factory. Despite a highly educated and generally well-qualified workforce, Cubas industrial sector is dilapidated after decades of underinvestment. The country produces little of value on the global market besides rum, tobacco and the professionals who earn billions for the government working as doctors, teachers or engineers in friendly third countries. The agricultural sector is in shambles, requiring the country to import most of its food. Economy Minister Alejandro Gil said Saturday that Cuba would spend $5 billion on food and petroleum products this year. Over the last 20 years, many of those billions came from Venezuelas socialist government, which has deep ties to Cubas and sent nearly 100,000 barrels of oil daily for years. With Venezuelas economic collapse, that has roughly halved, along with deep cutbacks in the economic relationship across the board. And the news has been bad in virtually every other sector of the Cuban economy. Nickel production has dropped from 79,950 tons in 2011 to 50,000 last year, according to Rodriguez, the former economics minister. The sugar harvest dropped nearly 44 percent, to a million tons. The number of tourists grew only 1 percent, with many coming on cruise ships, a relatively unprofitable type of visitor. Overall GDP growth has been stuck at 1 percent for the last three years. Meanwhile, under agreements Castro struck to rehabilitate Cubas creditworthiness, the country is paying $2 billion in debt service to creditors such as Russia, Japan and the Paris Club. State-run stores that sell low-quality Chinese household goods at double or triple their price outside the country are facing competition from vendors in Panama, Guyana, Mexico, Haiti and even Russia, where Cubans fly in, fill suitcases with goods, and return to sell them at a profit. That overseas shopping has become a vacuum sucking precious hard currency out of Cuba. Economist Omar Everleny Perez said he estimated that Cubans spent more than $2 billion a year buying products overseas. With less cash on hand, theres been even less in the state-run stores. The manager of the butcher shop where Castell waited for chicken last week said she needed 80 boxes of chicken to fill that days demand and only 40 arrived. Fears of a return to darker times are growing. ""During the special period we had it bad, like everyone. Even when we had money we couldnt buy anything,"" said Castell, a mother of six. ""It was really rough, blackouts, no food at all, I dont want to go back to that,"" said Ariadne Medina, a 47-year-old worker in a private restaurant who was waiting to buy chicken behind Castell. Independent experts say a return to the depths of the special period is unlikely. Cuba does business with dozens of nations, hosts nearly 5 million tourists a year and Cubans can travel freely to dozens of countries on direct flights to the US, Europe and Latin America. Expatriates send billions home in annual remittances. ""The new government is trying to halt the deterioration, but its a tough assignment,"" Perez said. ""Its going to take resources and time.""",
"Under Trump change, Cuba business partners can now be sued",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trump-change-cuba-business-partners-now-sued-62770772,05/02/19,abcnews.go.com,"On Thursday, Mickael Behn and Javier Garcia Bengochea filed what were believed to be the first lawsuits against European and American companies doing business on confiscated properties in Cuba MIAMI -- In 1958, Jose Ramon Lopez's father owned Cuba's main airport, its national airline and three small hotels. Conchita Beltran's family had about 2,160 acres (874 hectares) of sugar and tobacco fields. And the families of Mickael Behn and Javier Garcia Bengochea had docks in Havana and Santiago de Cuba. All properties were taken in Cuba's socialist revolution. The dispossessed families later moved to the United States and abandoned hope of compensation as Cuba and the U.S. severed relations and fought during decades of the Cold War. But on Thursday, Behn and Garcia Bengochea filed what were believed to be the first lawsuits against European and American companies doing business on confiscated properties in Cuba -- thanks to the Trump administration's decision to activate a provision of the U.S. embargo on the island. Known as Title III of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, the section allows Americans, and Cubans who later became Americans, to sue almost any company deemed to be ""trafficking"" in property confiscated by Cuba's government. Every president since the law's passage has suspended Title III because of objections from U.S. allies doing business in Cuba and because of the potential effect on future negotiated settlements between the U.S. and Cuba. The law contains exceptions for residential properties, properties worth less than $50,000 and properties linked to travel to Cuba deemed legal under U.S. law. Its activation, however, could generate dozens or even hundreds of lawsuits, along with trade fights between the U.S. on one side and countries including Spain, France and Britain on the other. Behn and Garcia Bengochea, who filed cases in federal court in Miami, are the heirs of families that owned ports which are now being used to dock cruise ships that began traveling to Cuba in 2016 under President Barack Obama's detente with the island. Behn's grandfather, American William C. Behn, was president of the company Havana Docks, which owned three docks in the capital that were confiscated in 1960. Mickael Behn, a television executive who lives between Miami and London, says he is suing Carnival Cruise Corporation for up to three times the current value of the docks, as permitted under the law. Bengochea, a neurosurgeon who lives in northeast Florida, owns 80 percent of the shares of the confiscated Cuban company La Maritima, which operated the port of Santiago de Cuba. He is suing for up to $20 million. ""We want to get justice,"" said Bob Martinez, the lawyer for both men. ""This was a robbery and what we're trying to get is compensation for the illegal use of these properties."" But for George Fowler, an attorney who has advised Carnival on Cuban matters, the law provides an exception for companies that go to Cuba legally, like the cruise lines. For that reason, he said, the Helms-Burton law does not apply to them. ""I don't think the lawsuits are going to go very far,"" said Fowler, who also is vice-chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, a Cuban exile organization. ""It is all about money,"" he said after explaining that Carnival agrees with him. During the Obama administration, the cruise companies were issued licenses by the Treasury Department to carry American passengers to Cuba. Other potential major targets include Spanish hotel chains Melia and Iberostar, Pernod Ricard of France, and other U.S. cruise lines that dock at ports confiscated from U.S. residents."" Lawyers and potential plaintiffs say they expect only a trickle of lawsuits at first due to the expense and complexity of filing litigation under a law that is being put into effect for the first time and touches on issues of international trade and sovereignty. Suing is also expensive, with initial filing fees of more than $6,500 a case, and there is the difficulty and expense of proving ownership with old Cuban documents. For its part, Cuba fears it's already lagging levels of foreign investment could be permanently crippled as a result of the activation of the provision. At a Cuban government-organized May Day parade Wednesday in Havana, marchers carried signs and chanted slogans denouncing the Helms-Burton law. The law ""was an effort to tie the hands of any president to improve relations with Cuba,"" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba's director-general of U.S. affairs, told The Associated Press in Washington. ""No doubt that there will be a threatening effect that will inhibit some investors of going to Cuba. We cannot ignore that that will occur,"" he said. ""It will perhaps have an impact on the living standards, the living conditions, of common Cubans ... It will damage perhaps the relationship of the United States and Cuba more than it is today."" On Thursday, the European Union also said it could file a World Trade Organization lawsuit or levy its own sanctions against U.S. entities that sue under Title III. ""The EU sees the extraterritorial application of unilateral restrictive measures as violating international law, and will take all appropriate measures,"" the EU said in a statement. Others, however, celebrated the first lawsuits. Orlando Gutierrez Boronat, from the exile group Cuban Democratic Directorate, said that the lawsuits have a clear message. ""Everyone who wants to invest in Cuba will have to go to federal court,"" he said after a press conference in front of the downtown court where the suits were filed. Beltran said her family had 860 acres (348 hectares) of sugar fields and 1,300 acres (526 hectares) of tobacco in western Pinar del Rio province. She has no idea if she will be able to sue a foreign corporation doing business related to her properties, but she is optimistic. ""God willing, I want to see restitution or compensation before I die,"" said Beltran, 76, who fled to Miami in 1961. She said her husband died 35 years ago dreaming of some form of compensation for their loss. ""For me, justice is being done,"" she said of the decision to activate the law. The Justice Department has certified some 6,000 claims worth approximately $8 billion at current values. There are an additional 200,000 uncertified claims, many by Cuban-Americans, whose value could reach into the tens of billions of dollars. One of the uncertified claims belongs to Lopez, whose family had owned the airport, airline Cubana de Aviacion and three hotels in Havana and the southern city of Cienfuegos since 1952. Along with the airlines Aeromexico, LATAM of Chile and Copa of Panama, Lopez said he is preparing documents to sue the Cuban government and Melia, which runs the Cienfuegos hotel. He said he isn't worried by the potential investment of time or money. ""At the end of the day they're going to recognize that it's ours,"" said Lopez, a 65-year-old retiree who divides his time between Madrid and Miami. ""The moment has finally come."" ------ Associated Press writer Gisela Salomon reported this story in Miami and AP writer Michael Weissenstein reported from Havana.",
Cuba: Police Move to Exile Pro-U.S. Dissident to Guyana,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/05/20/cuba-police-exile-pro-u-s-dissident-to-guyana-threaten-to-disappear-him-if-he-returns/,05/20/19,www.breitbart.com,"Daniel Llorente, an independent Cuban dissident who has repeatedly protested the communist regime by waving a U.S. flag in public, told the Cuban-American news outlet Radio Marti this weekend that police forcibly expelled him to Guyana in the dead of night, threatening to ""disappear"" him if he ever returned. Llorente, a dissident who does not belong to any opposition groups on the island, spent a year in a psychiatric facility after interrupting the communists 2017 May Day parade by running ahead of it waving an American flag. Llorentes son Eliecer told international media following the incident that state doctors told him his father was mentally disturbed for affirming a belief in God and subjected him to electroshock torture. Prior to his abrupt abduction and expulsion from the country, Llorente had posted on Facebook that he was planning a new wave of protests with a shirt reading ""no more dictatorship."" Marti did not update on the status of 18-year-old Eliecer Llorente. The younger Llorente was most recently arrested in April after accompanying his father to Havanas UNICEF headquarters to demand aid for Cuban children suffering poverty and malnutrition under the corrupt Castro regime. Daniel Llorente - speaking from Georgetown, Guyana - told Marti Friday that police had confiscated his passport last week before waking him at 4 a.m. and forcing him on a flight to Guyana. They denied him time to pack or say goodbye to friends and family, he said, adding that he only managed to call Marti because of the generosity of a Cuban-American he met in Georgetown attempting to bring his relatives to the United States. ""On Wednesday, the 15th, they got to my house in the afternoon and said 'Daniel, where is your passport? We want to verify that your passport is ok. They took it away. Then at 4 a.m. on Thursday, they knocked on my door. 'You have to come with us. Directly to the airport,"" Llorente said. ""All I have is the clothes Im wearing and my bookbag with a Bible in it,"" he told Marti. The dissident said that Cuban police warned him that he would ""disappear"" if he ever resurfaced on the island. ""This is what we are going to do with you,"" Llorente quoted the agents as saying. ""You are going to get on this plane. You will find out where you are going once you are on the plane. Since you talk about the Americans so much, when you get to the country where you are going, tell them to help you there."" ""Pray to God you dont return to Cuba, because if you return to Cuba, this time we will disappear you. This is a last chance we are giving you,"" Llorente said the agents warned him. As of Monday morning, Llorentes whereabouts and immigration status are unknown. Neither Guyanese nor Cuban officials answered Martis request for comment and Llorente has not posted any updates of his location on social media. The Castro regime has similarly used arbitrary arrest and forced expulsion - violations of the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Cuba is a signatory - in the recent past to silence critics on the island. In February, Eliecer Gongora, a member of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) dissident group, also surfaced in Guyana against his will. The government of Guyana agreed to host the U.S. State Departments primary processing center for Cuban refugees seeking to enter the country in March 2018. The State Department under President Barack Obama reopened the U.S. embassy in Havana, leading to reports of dozens of American diplomats and their families suffering unspecified brain damage after what American investigators deemed attacks of an unknown origin, first believed to be caused by sonic waves but later theorized to be the product of a microwave weapon. President Donald Trump thus withdrew non-essential personnel from the Havana embassy to protect them from more attacks, leaving Bogota, Colombia - and later Georgetown - as the new centers for processing Cuban refugees. Llorente will likely now have to make the case for political asylum in the United States. He has an extensive record of dissidence in Cuba and ample evidence of threats against him. His best-known act of dissidence - interrupting the 2017 May Day parade - was caught on video, as was the beating he received at the hands of plain-clothed Cuban regime agents before being hauled away and forced into a mental hospital. The Castro regime has used Havanas top mental hospital, known commonly as ""Mazorra,"" to imprison and torture political dissidents for decades. Llorente spent over a year in Mazorra without a diagnosis and was never charged with a crime. Following his release in May 2018, Llorente vowed to continue his political activism, particularly his public embrace of American values. It took little time for police to arrest him again. In February, Llorente was arrested in Havana following a deadly tornado. Llorente traveled to the Regla neighborhood - where angry tornado victims had recently forced Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel to evacuate - to help the victims demand food and humanitarian supplies, which the regime had been charging them money for. Llorente was again detained in mid-April along with son Eliecer, this time allegedly forced to take a nationwide tour of ""historical site of the Revolution"" to indoctrinate them both against protest. During this arrest, Llorente said he was first threatened with a one-way flight to Guyana. Llorente did not stop protesting, however, wearing the U.S. flag in public, which is not a crime in Cuba. Two weekends ago, Cuban police again arrested Llorente for waving a U.S. flag in public; he posted on Facebook that authorities arrested him believing he was en route to participate in an illegal LGBT pride parade that had attracted over 300 people, but Llorente said he had no such plans. Llorente had posted to Facebook on May 13 that he had new plans to protest, publishing images of a t-shirt he said he had printed to wear as ""a uniform."" ""Cuban wake up now! No more hypocrisy, no more dictatorship,"" read one side of the shirt, while the other featured a quote by Cuban founding father Jose Marti - ""Freedom is the right that all men have to be honorable, to think and speak without hypocrisy"" - and the phrase ""God bless the sincere friendship the U.S. has and wants with the people of Cuba.""

Gutierrez-Boronat: Cuban Freedom Movement Resurges in Trump Era,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2019/09/28/cuba-movement-thrives-in-trump-era/,09/28/19,www.breitbart.com,"A remarkable story is taking place in Florida and the mainstream media has missed it. It deals with the political recovery of the Cuban-American community in its decades-long struggle to free Cuba from a brutal Communist dictatorship. Barely three years ago, it seemed that the Cuban Communist regime had finally outflanked freedom forces within Cuba and in the Cuban-American enclaves in the United States. On December 2014, Raul Castro and Barack Obama announced the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cubas Communist Regime. The Obama Administration initiated a unilateral process of political and economic concessions. Serious efforts were made by the administration and Congress to repeal the Cuban Liberty Act, which places democracy and human rights at the top of U.S. relations towards the island. Sadly, even some prominent businessmen in Miamis Cuban-American community had endorsed these questionable efforts. Media outlets in the U.S. had bought into the narrative of a supposedly reformist Raul Castro as a legitimate ruler who was willing to hand over power and unveil a new constitution. The regimes multiple crimes against humanity and its persistent repression were cast aside as inconvenient. It appeared as if the Cuban resistance had finally been defeated. Today, the Cuban Communist regime, now bereft of its Pharaonic founder and maximum leader, is beset by economic sanctions that have affected its main sources of income and by growing internal unrest, which shows no sign of abating. Cruise tourism from the U.S. to the island has ended, and many whose properties were unlawfully confiscated by the regime are now able to sue third-party exploiters of these properties in U.S. courts. Raul Castro and his brood have been designated as gross violators of human rights and sanctioned by the U.S. government as legislatures in at least three Latin American countries are today considering the unprecedented possibility of prosecuting the Castro regime for its crimes against humanity. This initiative has also been supported by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Centrist International, one of the largest networks of political parties in the world. What happened then? The Castro regime continued to be what it is, and the free Cubans did not give up. In December 2014, the official policy of the United States towards the island was replaced by a confusing and ambiguous economic agenda that relegated the issues of human rights and democracy. The regime never had any interest in taking a substantial step towards the United States. Instead, Cubas totalitarian regime targeted and injured U.S. diplomats with what appear to be microwave weapons, deepened and consolidated its control over Venezuela, and intensified its internal repression. Rather than seeing in the U.S. opening a possibility of substantial internal and external transformations of its systems, opening up the island politically and economically to its own citizens, the Castro regime heightened and prolonged political and cultural controls. It found in the U.S. opening an opportunity to prolong its monolithic control of power and not the moment to begin national reconciliation and democratic reconstruction. Aware of the nature of the beast, the Cuban-American community came together in a broad coalition that, from the U.S. Congress to the streets of Miami, mobilized citizens, legislators, and local, national, and international political leaders. Capable Cuban-American legislators prevented the Cuban Liberty Act from being repealed by Congress. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a broad coalition of Cuban American freedom organizations within Cuba and in the United States, persistently mobilized the community. Through petitions, protests, and rallies, the community came together in advocacy of significant sanctions against the Castro dictatorship. In what observers thought was a movement against all odds, committed activists focused on ending cruise tourism to the island and in favor of full implementation of Title III of the Cuban Liberty Act, which permits rightful owners of confiscated properties in the island to sue third party exploiters in U.S. courts. Continued courageous resistance inside Cuba and the plight of political prisoners inspired these efforts. The continuous and diverse public events demonstrated sufficient numbers and intensity that showed that the key Cuban-American core vote was opposed to Obamas policy towards Cuba. The civic organizations, which make up the core of the community, supported the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association in its endorsement of Donald Trump as the candidate with the most coherent policy proposal towards Cuba. The massive vote of the Cuban diaspora for Trump, which was key for his victory in Florida, was in many ways primarily a plebiscite on Obamas policy towards Cuba. Blinded by ideology, made to order boutique polls and mainstream media spin, most presidential campaigns missed the point in 2016: The cause of Cubas freedom will not disappear until it is achieved. It is an intergenerational struggle that has continued unabated for 60 years. The rejection of the Castro regime is deep and resolute for a majority of the Cuban population inside and outside the island. Above all, it is a serious political error to underestimate the level of conviction of the Cuban diaspora. It constitutes an intergenerational commitment imbricated with the communitys very identity. It will neither wither nor dilute while the repressive conditions that caused the separation of thousands of Cuban families from their homeland remain.

HAVANA -- A much-lauded overseas medical program has become the focus of accusations that it serves as cover for fomenting protests against governments opposed by Cuba. Cuba said Friday that its pulling 700 members of its medical mission to Bolivia after the arrest of four members of the program, which began under now-exiled President Evo Morales. The four were accused of rallying against the government that took over from Morales, a Cuban ally. Authorities did not say when or how the 700 people would be brought back to Cuba, but they demanded the release of the four people detained, which include a general practitioner and a specialist in intensive therapy. The group was found with Bolivian currency worth $100,000 in a backpack, money that local officials allege was going to be used to finance protests, but Cuban authorities said was for salaries and housing costs related to the medical mission in La Paz. Bolivian authorities said in recent days that they believe Venezuelans, Cubans and even former guerrilla fighters from Colombia have been participating in the violent protests. They said they are collecting information and would release details soon. The end of Cubas 400-person medical mission to Ecuador was also announced this week, along with the accusation by Ecuadors interior minister that Cuba misused official passports to bring in 250 Cubans during protests against President Lenin Moreno, whom Cuba also opposes.

Five years ago the United States and Cuba agreed to resume diplomatic ties and begin normalising relations after more than 50 years of hostility. The thaw was hailed by many as a turning point in relations between the two countries, which had remained frozen in a Cold War-era standoff. But looking back on the optimism of December 17, 2014, analysts now say the effects of the milestone agreement have been curtailed by the administration of US President Donald Trump and the spillover from the crises in Venezuela. Under the landmark deal, announced by then-presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro after months of secret talks, embassies were reopened, prisoners exchanged and restrictions on tourism to Cuba relaxed. In the years since, the agreement has languished, weathering numerous rollbacks and sluggish implementation of some of its promises. Under the Trump administration, which has directed a near about-turn in US foreign policy towards Cuba, limits on tourism have been reimposed and a harsher policy towards Cuban migrants and refugees adopted. In the last week, Cubas top diplomat told AFP news agency that Havana is bracing for the possibility that Washington might completely sever relations once again, effectively erasing all tangible traces of the deal. Raul Castro, left, and Barack Obama announced the deal after months of secret talks [File: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters] ""For various reasons, the Trump administration has decided, as it has done with so many policies implemented by President Obama, that it wants to do the opposite,"" James Mahon, a professor of political science at Williams College, Massachusetts, told Al Jazeera. Washington has piled pressure on Havana on several fronts; passing legislation to block US cruise ships from docking in the Cuban capital and halting all flights to the islands other airports. ""I just got back and I noticed a really drastic change,"" Carlos Seiglie, a professor of economics at Rutgers University said, adding that Havanas residents appeared ""depressed"" by the reversal of fortunes. 191026055256596 ""The restrictions on cruise ships being able to dock in Havana [has] really destroyed the taxis, the food [sellers], the individuals who sold little souvenirs, the markets that sold souvenirs are just empty and that wasnt the case a year ago,"" he told Al Jazeera. A key factor driving the Trump administrations more hostile approach to Cuba is the desire to appeal to largely-Republican Cuban American voters in the key swing state of Florida, Mahon said. The 2014 deal is extremely unpopular among the influential community, many of whose families fled persecution in Cuba under former leader Fidel Castro. Activists and Republicans have criticised the agreement for making too many concessions to Cuba without reciprocal efforts by the one-party state to liberalise its economy or improve human rights protections. ""There are many Cuban Americans in the Miami metropolitan area who will vote entirely on the basis of Cuba policy,"" Mahon told Al Jazeera. Human rights a 'secondary concern Cubas human rights record is frequently cited by critics of the deal and has long been a stumbling block for improving relations with the US. 190826231326774 The appointment of Miguel Diaz-Canel as president in April 2018 and the announcement of a constitutional referendum held earlier this year prompted some hopes of reform, which rights groups say have largely been dashed. ""It was the first time in many decades that the country had a president born after the 1959 Revolution. There was some hope that change could be possible [...] However, 18 months later, nothing has changed,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, which is barred by Havana from doing work on the island. Several other independent rights organisations are also banned. ""We have documented the continued detention, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders, political activists and independent journalists. Those who peacefully protest or express even subtle criticism of the governments political or economic model are frequently targeted,"" Guevara-Rosas told Al Jazeera. ""For many Cubans, significant structural change to the human rights situation in Cuba is inconceivable any time soon."" However, Mahon said human rights were a ""secondary concern"" for the Trump administration, saying cementing support in Florida and affecting regime change in Venezuela were more pressing. ""I would put human rights way down the list of concerns for the current US government,"" he said. ""If there were a state somewhere that had lots of refugees or exiles from North Korea and that state were as big as Florida and it were a swing state, Donald Trump would not be negotiating anything with North Korea."" A US State Department official told Reuters news agency this week that there were ""no plans to break off diplomatic ties"" with Havana, but ""one thing that has clearly reached a low point is the Castro regimes abuses of its own people"". ""In addition, the regime is spreading its totalitarian repression to other countries in the region,"" the official added, speaking to the news agency on the condition of anonymity.

China pneumonia outbreak: Mystery virus probed in Wuhan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50984025,01/03/20,www.bbc.com,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The outbreak has occurred in the city of Wuhan

Chinese authorities have launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia which has infected dozens of people in the central city of Wuhan.

A total of 44 cases have been confirmed so far, 11 of which are considered ""severe"", officials said on Friday.

The outbreak has prompted Singapore and Hong Kong to bring in screening processes for travellers from the city.

It comes amid online fears the virus could be linked to Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.

The potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus killed more than 700 people around the world in 2002-03, after originating in China.

There has been speculation on social media about a possible connection to the highly contagious disease.

Wuhan police said eight people had been punished for ""publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification"".

The Wuhan health commission said on Friday it was investigating the cause of the outbreak.

In a statement on its website, it said it had already ruled out a number of infection sources - including influenza, avian influenza and common respiratory diseases - but did not mention Sars.

There has also been no human-to-human transmission, the statement added. However, a number of those infected worked at a seafood market in the city, leading authorities to clean the area.

A spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was aware of the outbreak and was in contact with the Chinese government.

""There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus,"" the spokesman added. ""WHO is closely monitoring this event and will share more details as we have them. ""

Fears sparked by an older epidemic

Analysis by BBC Health's Philippa Roxby

This latest outbreak appears to have sparked memories for those who dealt with a Sars epidemic 18 years ago.

At the time, the WHO criticised China for under-reporting the number of cases of Sars in a southern Chinese province.

In the 2002-03 epidemic, the virus affected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries, killing 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong.

Travellers flying to other countries are thought to have been behind the large number of cases in that outbreak because Sars spreads quickly without swift treatment in hospital.

China sacked its health minister at the time for the poor handling of the crisis.

The country has been free of Sars since May 2004.",

A total of 59 cases have been reported in the city of Wuhan, seven of which are considered critical.

An epidemic of the potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus killed more than 700 people around the world in 2002-03, after originating in China.

In a statement posted on its website late on Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 163 people who had had contact with those infected had been placed under medical observation. It said efforts were continuing to identify the virus and its source.

The commission said previously that there had been no human-to-human transmission of the illness. It added that a number of those infected worked at a seafood market in the city, leading authorities to sanitise the area.

Singapore and Hong Kong have both set up systems to check travellers arriving from Wuhan for possible fever.

Hong Kong has admitted 16 travellers with pneumonia-like symptoms to hospital, the South China Morning Post reported, but none have so far been found to have the unidentified strain. Singapore has had one suspicious case, it added.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is aware of the outbreak and is in contact with the Chinese government.

China has been battling what may be a new strain of pneumonia after 59 people contracted a mysterious respiratory illness in central China, prompting fears of another Sars outbreak.

Health officials are worried about the upcoming Spring Festival in late January, when China celebrates lunar new year and millions of people will be travelling across the country to go home. Authorities have warned citizens to be on the lookout for symptoms like fever, difficulty breathing or body ache.

On Tuesday, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said health officials had “strengthened measures on all borders”. Since Monday, all travellers arriving on trains from Wuhan have been subjected to body temperature checks.

Health authorities in Wuhan first reported 27 cases of an unidentified pneumonia-like illness at the end of December, a figure that jumped to 59 as of Sunday. The patients, seven of whom are in critical condition, have been quarantined. There have been no reported deaths.

Authorities said epidemiologists have ruled out the possibility of Sars, the deadly respiratory virus that spread to at least 37 countries and killed more than 800 people in 2002 and 2003, an outbreak made worse by a government cover-up.

Wuhan officials said there was no “clear” evidence of human-to-human transmission. Investigators also ruled out Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and bird flu. Symptoms of the mysterious virus include fevers, problems breathing and invasive lesions to both lungs, shown in radiographs.

Some of the patients worked at a seafood market in the city, according to the health commission, suggesting the possibility of animal-to-human transmission. Several shops at the market also sold wild animals including birds, snakes, deer, groundhogs, according to Chinese media reports.

The market has been shuttered since New Year’s Day. Shopkeepers nearby said they were concerned about the apparent outbreak but continued normal operations.

“Of course we are worried but we don’t wear face masks. It isn’t good for business and also nothing has been confirmed yet,” said a woman surnamed Huang, who sells eyeglasses near the seafood market.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday it was closely monitoring the situation and was in “close contact” with Chinese authorities. “There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology,” the organisation said.

Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, is a major urban centre with a population of more than 10 million. Local authorities have identified 120 close contacts that are now under medical observation, according to the WHO. Wuhan authorities said they were also carrying out extra sanitation and hygiene measures, and investigating the cause of the virus.

Elsewhere in the region citizens braced for the worst. In Hong Kong, which was hit badly by the Sars outbreak, shoppers stockpiled face masks. Hospitals have reported 21 patients with fevers and other respiratory symptoms who recently visited Wuhan. Seven have been discharged and the other cases have so far not proven to be related to the cluster in Wuhan.

In Singapore, where travellers coming from the city are now required to go through temperature screening, a three-year-old Chinese girl who had travelled to Wuhan was quarantined. On Sunday, officials said she had a common childhood respiratory infection.

Authorities also appear to worried about panic spreading, with censors on Weibo blocking the hashtag #WuhanSARS. While Chinese media have been reporting on the outbreak, citizens who remember the Sars cover-up still mistrust the information released by their government.

Online internet users questioned authorities assurance that there were no examples of “clear human-to-human transmission” of the infection.

One user wrote: “Do we have to wait until it is ‘obvious’ before we fix the situation?”

In total, 41 people have been diagnosed with the pathogen, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media earlier this week pointed to a new type of coronavirus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website.

More:

Two of them have been discharged from hospital and the rest are in a stable condition, while 739 people deemed to have been in close contact with the patients have been cleared, it said.

The man who died was a regular buyer at the seafood market, and had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease, it said.

Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of January 9 when his heart failed.

The commission added that no new cases had been detected since January 3.

The Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at a seafood market in the city, and that to date, no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.

The World Health Organization said on Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.

The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad.

The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via aeroplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.

The Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and, as of Friday, had completed nucleic acid tests.",

A man in his 30s from Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, tested positive, the ministry said.

The man had been to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where there has been an outbreak of pneumonia believed to be caused by the new coronavirus strain, it said.

He reportedly returned from China to Japan with a fever and was hospitalised. He was released on Wednesday after the symptoms subsided, according to the health ministry statement.

The World Health Organization (WHO) had earlier warned that the new virus could spread and alerted hospitals worldwide.

On Monday, a Chinese woman was also ordered quarantined in Thailand after contacting the virus, authorities said.

Authorities in Asia have stepped up monitoring at airports ahead of next week's Lunar New Year holiday when hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists are expected to travel domestically and abroad.

On Wednesday, the US State Department also issued a health alert about travel to the Wuhan region. It referenced a Watch Level 1 Alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions.

On Saturday, Chinese authorities announced that a 61-year-old man died from pneumonia, a symptom of the disease, in Wuhan.

In total, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in China, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media show could have been caused by a new type of coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can lead to infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe. SARS originated in southern China in 2002 and infected more than 8,000 people in 37 countries before it was brought under control. Nearly 800 people died.

""The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,"" WHO said in a statement.

It comes as disease-modelling experts warned that far more people may have been affected by the previously unknown virus than thought.

The Wuhan municipal health commission said in a statement that four patients diagnosed with pneumonia on Thursday were in a stable condition, taking the total number of cases to nearly 50. The statement released in the early hours on Saturday is the first confirmation of new cases by the commission in nearly a week.

On Friday, the commission announced the second death from the virus. A 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital with abnormal renal function and severe damage to multiple organs, and died on 15 January, the commission said.

Preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed the pathogen could be from a new type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).

World Health Organization disease-modelling experts based at Imperial College, London, said that far more people may have been infected and they warned human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out.

Prof Neil Ferguson and colleagues, from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial, calculated that the number of cases in Wuhan may be more than 1,700. “It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,” they said in a report.

The report said all hospitalised cases of pneumonia or severe respiratory disease in the Wuhan area and other well-connected Chinese cities should be investigated.

They cautioned that because of the unknown factors in their estimates, the case numbers could be anywhere from 190 to over 4,000. But in a tweet, they said that “the magnitude of these numbers suggests that substantial human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out. Heightened surveillance, prompt information sharing and enhanced preparedness are recommended.”

Their calculation is based on the two people in Thailand and one in Japan who were diagnosed with the virus. Based on flight and population data, said Ferguson, “there is only a 1 in 574 chance that a person infected in Wuhan would travel overseas before they sought medical care. This implies there might have been over 1,700 (3 x 574) cases in Wuhan so far.”

US authorities announced they would begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan on direct or connecting flights at three airports: San Francisco, New York’s JFK and Los Angeles. Authorities in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have all stepped up screening.

In Australia, the New South Wales and Victorian governments both issued alerts to health professionals about the virus, but there was no specific screening for the virus or change to travel advice.

Japan and Thailand both reported new cases of the mystery strain of coronavirus virus this week and experts say it might spread further as a result of the Chinese lunar new year holiday starting next week, which sees millions of people travel across the country.

On Thursday Japan confirmed a man in his 30s had been infected with the virus, and a Chinese woman was quarantined in Thailand. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned a wider outbreak is possible.

On Friday, Thailand confirmed a second case. A 74-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan had been quarantined since her arrival on Monday and was found to be infected with the newly identified coronavirus, said Sukhum Karnchanapimai, permanent secretary of the Public Health Ministry.

Sukhum also urged Thais to remain calm, saying that there was no outbreak in the country.

The Wuhan health commission said late on Thursday that 12 people had recovered and been discharged from hospital but five others were in serious condition. It also said no human-to-human transmission had been confirmed but the possibility “cannot be excluded”.

Another WHO doctor said it would not be surprising if there was “some limited human-to-human transmission, especially among families who have close contact with one another”.

“It is not surprising that we are starting to hear of more cases in other countries and a range of severity from asymptomatic, to mild and severe illness,” said infectious disease expert and director of Wellcome Dr Jeremy Farrar.

“It is possible that the often mild symptoms from this coronavirus may be masking the true numbers of people who have been infected, or the extent of person-to-person transmission. It is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission.”

The first confirmed fatality from the virus was a 61-year-old man in Wuhan who died of pneumonia after testing positive.

Memories remain fresh in Asia of a 2002-03 outbreak of Sars, which emerged in China and killed nearly 800 people around the world.

CDC to screen at three US airports for signs of new virus from China,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/17/health/wuhan-virus-us-airport-screenings-china-bn/index.html,01/17/20,edition.cnn.com,"(CNN) More than 100 staffers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being deployed to three US airports to check passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for fever and other symptoms of a mysterious new virus that's killed two and infected dozens in China, the CDC announced Friday.

It's a highly unusual step. The last time the CDC did routine passenger health screening was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, according to Dr. Martin Cetron , director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine.

""I've been here since 1996, and that's the only other time we've ever done this -- for Ebola,"" Cetron said.

The screenings at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport will start tonight, and screenings at San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport will begin Saturday. The CDC will look for symptoms such as coughing and difficulty breathing and check temperatures of each passenger with an infrared thermometer.

The CDC took these steps after travelers from Wuhan recently arrived in Thailand and Japan infected with the new virus. There have been two cases in Thailand and one in Japan.

""Considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries are likely,"" the World Health Organization stated in a press release Thursday.

Last year, more than 60,000 passengers flew into the United States from Wuhan, a city 700 miles south of Beijing. The vast majority flew into the three airports where the checks will take place, according to the CDC.

January is the peak travel season from China to the United States because of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Cetron said.

Cetron described the airport screenings as part of a set ""proactive preparedness precautions.""

""We believe the current risk to this virus is low,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a press conference on Friday. ""For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something they need to worry about.""

At this point, it appears most people caught the virus directly from animals, and the infection does not spread very easily from person to person.

""This is not a time for people to freak out and be overly concerned,"" Cetron said. ""This is a time for vigilance and awareness.""

He added that much more common illnesses, such as the flu, are ""much bigger threats"" to Americans than the new virus from China.

""I'm fully aware that the unknown is more of a source of anxiety than that which is already defined,"" he said. ""But we should not freak out.""

What we know about the new virus

So far, two people in China have died from this new virus, officially called the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Some 45 people in China have become infected. Some have developed pneumonia.

Coronaviruses, such as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome , are common in many species of animals, including camels and bats. Sometimes -- but rarely -- they evolve and infect humans as well.

Chinese health authorities have reported that most of the patients in Wuhan had visited a large seafood and animal market. However, some patients in the outbreak reportedly had not been to animal markets, which suggests that ""some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring,"" according to the CDC.

At least for now, that spread appears to be quite limited. Cetron said it's ""reassuring"" that Chinese authorities report that no health care workers who've cared for the patients have become infected, and that some 700 other contacts of patients have also not become ill.

""This isn't anywhere near in the same category as measles or flu,"" Cetron said. Those two infections spread easily from person to person.

To learn more about this new virus, health authorities are taking a close look at SARS.

In 2003, SARS spread to more than two dozen countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Worldwide, more than 8,000 people became sick and 774 died. In the United States, there were 29 SARS cases and no deaths, according to the CDC

SARS did spread person to person through close contact such as kissing, sharing utensils or talking to someone within 3 feet.

Cetron emphasized that this new virus may be different from its cousin and behave in unexpected ways.

""We have to have humility and appreciate that it may be different. We can't just assume that what we know from previous viruses will always apply,"" he said.

New screening procedures

Cetron said he expects that ""the vast majority"" of passengers arriving from Wuhan will be healthy. CDC will give them information in English and Mandarin about what symptoms to look for over the next two weeks.

After further investigation, travelers that are symptomatic will be sent to local hospitals that work with the CDC.

Cetron said the symptoms of the new virus are so common that he expects the screenings will catch many more people with the flu or other winter viruses than with the new coronavirus.

If it turns out someone does have the new virus, they'll be isolated in the hospital.

He added that while there are still many questions about this new virus -- its incubation period, for example, or how easily it spreads from person to person -- the progress on it in such a short time has been impressive, including a sequencing of the virus' genome

""It's quite remarkable to me that from a cluster of pneumonia detected just a little over a month ago in Wuhan, China, we have fully sequenced the virus and have some diagnostic capability to test for it,"" he said.",
Vaccine for new Chinese coronavirus in the works,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/20/health/coronavirus-nih-vaccine-development/index.html,01/20/20,edition.cnn.com,"(CNN) The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus that has infected hundreds and killed four in Asia.

""The NIH is in the process of taking the first steps towards the development of a vaccine,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauc i, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Fauci said it would take a few months until the first phase of the clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.

The latest

The virus, which was first reported at the end of December, has infected more than 200 people, according to a Chinese government-appointed expert. The bulk of the cases have been in China, but there have been four cases in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.

The virus originated in animals and can be spread from person to person. While most of the patients visited an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, a city about 700 miles south of Beijing, some did not.

Working on a vaccine

A team of scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

""The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats,"" Hotez said.

He added that it's less challenging to develop a vaccine for coronaviruses than for other viruses such as HIV or influenza.

""Every virus has its challenges, but coronaviruses can be a relatively straightforward vaccine target,"" Hotez said.

If a vaccine is developed, he said, health care workers might be among the first to receive it because they're exposed to infected patients.

It is ""remarkable"" that scientists are able to start developing a vaccine for a virus that was identified less than a month ago, he said.

He credited Chinese researchers, who quickly sequenced and published the virus's genome.

""With SARS, it took almost a year to be able to identify and map the full genetic code,"" he said. ""Now we're doing this in just a few weeks.""

'An evolving situation'

Fauci emphasized there are still many questions about this new virus.

""This is an evolving situation, and it's tough to predict ultimately where it will go,"" he said. ""But we have to take it very seriously.""

A few things are clear. One, the virus jumped from animals to humans, just like SARS did nearly two decades ago.

He added it's unclear whether just one type of animal is transmitting the virus to humans, or more than one type.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

He also said while it's clear this new virus can be spread from person to person, it's unclear how easily that spread can happen.

""Is it a continual spread? Is it sustained? We're not quite sure yet,"" he said.

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed there are many questions.

""This is one of those inflection moments in outbreak history where we have enough information to be very concerned, but not enough information to say this is going to be an international crisis,"" he said.",
China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/china-confirms-human-human-transmission-coronavirus-200120162507948.html,01/20/20,www.aljazeera.com,"Human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus strain has been confirmed in China, fueling fears of a major outbreak of the SARS-like virus as millions travel for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission, said on Monday patients may have contracted the new virus without having visited the central city of Wuhan where it was discovered before spreading across China and reaching three other Asian nations.

More:

""Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission,"" he said in an interview with China's CCTV state broadcaster.

Zhong said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members who had visited Wuhan.

He added that 14 medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have also been infected.

Human-to-human transmission could make the virus spread more quickly and widely.

Alarm in the region

The new coronavirus strain has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

The total number of people diagnosed with the latest strain of the virus rose to 218, according to CCTV.

South Korea on Monday reported its first case - a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan.

Thailand and Japan previously confirmed a total of three cases - all of whom had visited the Chinese city.

Meanwhile, a third person died in Wuhan, according to the local health commission.

Experts believe the epidemic ""can still be controlled"", the National Health Commission said on Sunday.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new cases in China were the result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"".

Wuhan authorities said they have installed infrared thermometers at airports, and railway and coach stations across the city. Passengers with fever were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions.

State TV footage showed medical staff working inside an isolation ward at a Wuhan hospital in hazmat suits.

In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital, Wuhan. More than 100 people are being monitored in the city.

Passengers are also being screened at some airports in Thailand and the United States.

Better handling

Chinese state media moved to calm the mood as discussion swelled on social media about the coronavirus spreading to other Chinese cities.

Weighing in on the matter for the first time, China's President Xi Jinping said on Monday that safeguarding people's lives should be given ""top priority"" and that the spread of the epidemic ""should be resolutely contained"", according to CCTV.

Xi said it was necessary to ""release information on the epidemic in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation"", and ensure people have a ""stable and peaceful Spring Festival"", the broadcaster said.",
New China virus: Cases triple as infection spreads to Beijing and Shanghai,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51171035,01/20/20,www.bbc.com,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC spoke to people in Beijing who seemed largely unconcerned about the virus

The number of people infected with a new virus in China tripled over the weekend, with the outbreak spreading from Wuhan to other major cities.

There are now more than 200 cases, mostly in Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Three people have died. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases.

The new strain of coronavirus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person to person, China confirmed.

Respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, who heads the health commission team investigating the virus, said 14 medical workers had caught it while treating patients, state media reported.

The sharp rise comes as millions of Chinese prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holidays.

Although the outbreak is believed to have originated from a market, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading.

The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus.

Experts in the UK told the BBC the number of people infected could still be far greater than official figures suggest, with estimates closer to 1,700.

What we know about the virus

2019-nCoV, as it's been labelled, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans

Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people

Scientists believe an animal source is ""the most likely primary source"" but that some human-to-human transmission has occurred

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties

People are being advised to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms

Who has been infected?

Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, on Monday said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city.

As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition.

Beijing also confirmed its first cases, with five people infected. Shanghai confirmed its first case on Monday - a 56-year-old woman who came from Wuhan.

In the city of Shenzhen, a major tech hub close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan.

State media reported 14 other cases in Guangdong province.

Four cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea - all of them involving people who are either from Wuhan or have visited the city.

In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital.

The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak.

Airports in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities last week announced similar measures at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.

What are the Chinese authorities saying?

How China is responding to the outbreak is under close scrutiny, given that it was widely criticised for initially covering up the Sars crisis in late 2002 and early 2003.

On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly addressed the outbreak, saying that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"".

The foreign ministry, meanwhile, said China was providing ""timely information about the disease"" and would ""work with all parties to deal with the virus"".

China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases in China were due to human-to-human transmission, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The commission had earlier said there had been no such cases, but that the virus had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Health officials have been analysing the seafood market where they believe the virus originated

The WHO also said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"".

""As more… cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter.

It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"".

What impact could Lunar New Year have?

From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays.

It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease.

Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics.

Authorities say they will now also be screening everyone leaving the city.

At Beijing's central railway station, some travellers donned masks but did not appear overly concerned about the virus.

""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager travelling to the region of Inner Mongolia, told the AFP news agency.

But the tone in Chinese social media, where the outbreak has been a top trending topic, was different.

""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?"" one Weibo user said.",

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced the first known case of a new strain of coronavirus in the US. In a Tuesday press conference, a CDC spokesman said a US citizen returning from a trip to central China had been diagnosed in Seattle.

According to the CDC, the man is in his 30s and is in good condition at a hospital in Everett, Washington after returning to the area last week.

While in China, the man traveled to the Wuhan area, where the virus is believed to originate. It has since spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai.

The US is the fifth country to report a case of the illness. Nearly 300 cases have been reported in China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. US authorities have begun screening air passengers coming from central China.

Quick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor? Show Hide What is Covid-19? Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.

Last month, health officials began reporting new cases of viral pneumonia, including symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Officials connected the patients to a food market in Wuhan.

So far there are six reported deaths, all in China. Most were 60 or older and had a previous medical condition. Although the virus likely originated from animal-to-people contact, Chinese officials this week confirmed their first case of person-to-person contraction.

CDC officials said the risk to the American public is low. According to Reuters, officials around the world have implement similar screenings to contain the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season.",
The Test a Deadly Coronavirus Outbreak Poses to China's Leadership,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html,01/21/20,www.nytimes.com,"WUHAN, China — Facing growing pressure to contain a deadly viral outbreak that has spread halfway around the world, China’s ruling Communist Party raced on Tuesday to confront the disease, slapping restrictions on the city where it started and warning that anyone who hides infections will be “forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame.”

The response by the Chinese leadership, which has come under intensifying criticism that it has been slow to acknowledge the severity of the outbreak, came as fatalities from the disease tripled to at least nine. Infections surged from 200 to 440, and global financial markets were rattled by the possibility of a pandemic emanating from the world’s most populous country during the Lunar New Year — Asia’s heaviest travel season.

Already, cases of the pneumonia-like virus have been found in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea, and on Tuesday the first was confirmed in the United States. Airports in Atlanta and Chicago said they would screen passengers from Wuhan, joining airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and cities around the world in doing so. North Korea temporarily closed its borders to foreign tours, the vast majority of them from China. The World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday over whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency.",

China's top leaders have warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of a new coronavirus that has now infected nearly 300 people.

Anyone who concealed new cases would ""be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity"", the political body responsible for law and order said.

The warning came as state media said six people had now died from the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia.

It's been confirmed the virus can pass from person to person.

The World Health Organization (WHO) will on Wednesday consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola. Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a co-ordinated international response.

China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. It said two people in Guangdong province had been infected in this way.

In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition.

The workers presumably became infected with the virus due to contact with patients. All of them are being kept in isolation while being treated.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have been infected with the virus

Where has the virus spread?

A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However most patients are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million at the heart of the outbreak.

The disease was first identified there late last year and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals.

A handful of cases have also been identified abroad: two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. Those infected had recently returned from Wuhan.

Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.

In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than one million people visiting last year.

How fast is it spreading?

There are fears that the virus could spread swiftly - and further across the country - as millions of people across China prepare to travel home for the Chinese New Year holidays later this week.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Millions in China are heading to their hometowns for Chinese New Year

This mass movement of people could also mean that authorities will not be able to monitor further spread of the disease.

And experts say there already could be many cases going undetected.

A report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300.

Why are there warnings against a cover-up?

The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus originating in China - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across several countries, mostly in Asia.

China initially withheld information about the epidemic from the public. It later vastly under-reported the number of people that had been infected, downplayed the risks and failed to provide timely information that experts say could have saved lives.

Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for ""all-out efforts"" to control the outbreak, according to state media, including quickly making information available and taking measures to ""guide public opinion"".

In its commentary published online on Tuesday, the Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Commission talked of China having learned a ""painful lesson"" from the Sars epidemic and called for the public to be kept informed.

Deception, it warned, could ""turn a controllable natural disaster into a man-made disaster"".

What do we know about the virus?

The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans.

It is believed to have originated from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan.

Chinese authorities have urged people to stop travelling in and out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of a new virus outbreak that has killed 17 people.

Those living in the city of 8.9 million people have also been told to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings.

The new virus has spread from Wuhan to several Chinese provinces, as well as the US, Thailand and South Korea.

There are 440 confirmed cases, with the origin a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"".

Late on Wednesday the Chinese authorities confirmed the number of dead had almost doubled - from nine - in the space of a day. All fatalities so far have been in Hubei, the province around Wuhan.

Officials in Hong Kong also reported the territory's first two cases.

Meanwhile, in Geneva, the World Health Organization's emergency committee is meeting to assess the global risks posed by the virus and decide if it should be declared an international public health emergency - as happened with swine flu and Ebola.

Such a declaration, if made, could see advice issued on travel or trade restrictions.

Chinese authorities admitted the country was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control.

""Basically, do not go to Wuhan. And those in Wuhan please do not leave the city,"" said National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin in one of the first public briefings since the beginning of the outbreak.

Earlier this week, China confirmed that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place.

The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. The Sars virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus.

Signs of infection with the new virus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities.

What is the latest on the outbreak?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption China health officials: ""Don't go to Wuhan, don't leave Wuhan""

Mr Li said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"". In general, coughs and sneezes are a highly effective way for viruses to spread.

But China has still not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus.

""Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic,"" said Mr Li.

He added that there were 2,197 people who were known to have come into contact with infected patients.

No ""super spreader"" - a patient who has transmitted the virus to more than 10 people - has been discovered so far.

At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan, who presumably came into contact with patients, are known to be infected.

Wuhan: Heart of the outbreak

Image copyright WANG ZHAO

It's not a Chinese mega-city as well known as Beijing or Shanghai, but Wuhan has connections with every part of the globe. Only slightly smaller than London, the city is home to an international airport that handles tens of millions of passengers each year.

These global links explain why the cases of the virus abroad have all involved people either from Wuhan or who had recently visited it.

The city has economic clout too - nearly half of the world's 500 biggest companies have invested there.

How fast is the virus spreading?

There's no way to know but it's likely to be exacerbated by the millions of people across China who are travelling within the country for the Lunar New Year week-long holiday. Thousands are also travelling abroad.

Image copyright Kevin Frayer Image caption Authorities confirmed that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place

Mr Li added that the festival would ""increase the risk of the disease spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control"".

He said strict measures to control the disease would be put in place, calling for those in Wuhan to ""avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings"".

These measures include temperature screening for all those leaving Wuhan, and improved sterilisation and ventilation at major transport hubs.

A ban on the trade of live poultry and wild animals has also been implemented in the city. State media reports said police were conducting spot checks to make sure this was enforced.

The disease may have originally been passed from an animal to a human, said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.

Where else have cases been reported?

There have been a handful of global cases: three cases in Thailand, one in Korea, one in Japan, one in Taiwan and one in the US.

On Wednesday, the city of Macau also reported its first confirmed case of the virus. The patient is said to be a businesswoman who arrived from Wuhan over the weekend.

Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Russia and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan.

The UK is expected to begin screening passengers arriving at London's Heathrow airport from Wuhan.

In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests.

Are the numbers accurate?

Experts say there could be many cases going undetected and they expect the official numbers to rapidly increase.

Researchers from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London now estimate that there have probably been about 4,000 cases in Wuhan.

The centre's director, Prof Neil Ferguson, however said that the Chinese authorities had been ""remarkably open"" amid an ""enormously demanding situation"".

Life inside ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/22/asia/wuhan-ground-zero-intl-hnk/index.html,01/22/20,edition.cnn.com,"Wuhan, China (CNN) The Lunar New Year -- the most important festival in the Chinese calendar -- is just three days away, but in the Chinese city of Wuhan, there are few reasons to celebrate.

A deadly outbreak of the new coronavirus emerged in this city of 11 million people last month. Within weeks, the virus has killed nine people , sickened hundreds and spread as far as the United States.

Wuhan has been on high alert since the number of confirmed infections surged into the hundreds earlier this week.

New year celebrations that had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people have been canceled. In some parts of the city, including a major shopping area, streets remain largely empty, with most people walking outside donning face masks.

In the city's center, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sits empty, its rows of stalls shuttered. Police and security officers in face masks stand guard outside, prohibiting anyone from filming or entering a cordoned off area.

The market has always been a popular spot at this time of the year, packed with shoppers stocking up on fish and seafood for Lunar New Year feasts with family and friends.

But this year, Chinese authorities and scientists say wild animals sold at this market are the likely source of the new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The virus -- which can infect humans and animals -- has since spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Officials in Washington state confirmed the first case on US soil Tuesday.

The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection, but health authorities have not found out which animals are the source.

'How can I not be worried?'

Not far from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Xiao Chuan'an, from a neighboring city, is selling sugar cane she imported from southern Guangdong province.

""I do feel a bit scared,"" she told CNN. ""How can I not be worried? The situation sounds really serious. The news on the phone sounds really scary.""

The country's National Health Commission confirmed this week the virus can be transmitted between people, after Wuhan health authorities maintained for two weeks that there was ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.""

The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been linked to the coronavirus outbreak in China.

A staff member talks with a driver as he checks the body temperatures of passengers at an exit of a highway in Wuhan on Tuesday.

In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, 270 people have been infected as of Wednesday, and nine of them have died, according to the commission. At least 453 cases had been confirmed throughout China, leading to fears of a possible epidemic.

Xiao said her family had repeatedly urged her to go home, fearing that she will catch the virus in Wuhan. But she wants to stay to sell the sugar cane. However, business has been bad -- people are too scared to come to the market to shop, she said.

""You can see now -- does it look like the atmosphere of Chinese New Year?"" she said. ""I don't know when the pneumonia epidemic will stop... I might have to eat instant noodles during Chinese New Year.""

Emergency measures

The city government announced a series of new measures Tuesday to contain the outbreak -- efforts some critics say came too late -- the virus has already spread to a dozen provinces across the country.

Tour agencies in Wuhan have been banned from taking groups out of the city. Infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.

Staff members disinfect the Hankou Railway Station in Wuhan on Wednesday.

The city has over 60 routes connecting Wuhan with international cities, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. It is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.

At the high-speed rail station, the only faces that stand out are the uncovered ones, with the vast majority of passengers donning masks. As they prepare to exit the station, a railway staff member -- also wearing a mask and gloves -- puts a thermometer at the head of each passenger, checking for a fever.

Commuters wearing face masks walk in Hankou railway station in Wuhan, where China's coronavirous outbreak first emerged last month.

On a high speed train from Beijing to Wuhan, railway attendants and security guards left their faces uncovered. A train attendant told CNN they were asked by management not to wear masks, as it may trigger a panic among passengers.

But she added that the train company is preparing to purchase masks and they will begin wearing them should the situation worsen.

Some hotels in the city said they will also screen guests, checking their temperature and asking them to sanitize their hands upon entry.

Commuters wait in line at Wuchang railway station in Wuhan on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, the general manager of the Westin hotel in Wuhan told CNN he had asked staff to start wearing face masks ""for both their safety and for the safety of our guests.""

Others, however, are less worried about the outbreak. Yan Weixi, a jackfruit seller who did not wear a mask, said she did not find the situation ""so scary.""

""I have been checking online instructions... like drinking more water or washing your hands more frequently. I think that should be fine,"" said Yan, from northeastern Heilongjiang province, who is spending her first Lunar New Year in Wuhan.

""The most important thing is to keep a positive attitude, because if you're more scared, it's more likely you would catch the virus,"" she said. ""That's my opinion.""",
Chinese state media downplays coronavirus as Xi strikes positive tone,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/chinese-state-media-downplays-coronavirus-as-xi-strikes-positive-tone,01/23/20,www.theguardian.com,"It has been splashed all over the front pages of newspapers around the world for days. But the outbreak of coronavirus, which has left at least 25 dead and infected more than 800, has been largely missing from China’s major state-run media.

Friday’s front page of the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist party’s flagship newspaper, displayed only warm wishes for lunar new year’s eve from the president, Xi Jinping, as he attended a spring festival gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

News of the coronavirus outbreak has also been buried during prime time CCTV news over the past two evenings, featuring as the fifth or sixth item on the daily 7pm bulletin.

Bill Bishop, the Washington-based author of the widely read Sinocism newsletter, said that despite the lack of front-page coverage Xi was “all in” in guiding efforts to control the outbreak. He said the clunky nature of the coverage was primarily a product of Communist party protocol.

“Anything about the general secretary is always first, and the top leaders have a set of ritual meetings the week before the new year that always get top billing,” Bishop said.

“Other CCTV news programs are doing a lot of reporting, as are lots of other official media.

“They can not show any signs of panic, so the party media efforts are around showing resolve, action and competence.”

The lack of prominent display of the outbreak by the party-run media comes as outlets such as Caixin, the country’s most open business news outlet, and others have been allowed to report more freely, giving some measure of transparency to the outbreak.

Caixin has a team of nine reporters in Wuhan that are now under the general quarantine and cannot leave the city because of the transport stoppages. It’s global site in English reports that health authorities in China “have been grappling” with the outbreak of the virus which it says has spread to all provinces except Tibet and Qinghai. But its Chinese site leads on GDP figures, with the outbreak relegated to fourth spot.

“How unleashed Caixin and other media are allowed to be will be more interesting over the next week or so,” Bishop said.

“They seem to have a latitude, a rarity in the Xi era, but I wonder how much they can dig out before they get smacked down by the censors.”",

Lockdown measures are increasing across China's Hubei province to try to control the spread of a new virus that has left 18 people dead in the country.

Wuhan, Hubei's capital of 11 million people where the virus first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out.

At least five other provincial cities are seeing clampdowns on transport.

There are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has spread abroad, with Singapore and Vietnam the latest affected.

The new strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated at a market in Wuhan. One resident of the city said the atmosphere there felt like ""the end of the world"".

The lockdowns come as millions of Chinese people travel across the country for the Lunar New Year holiday.

What's the latest in China?

All the fatalities bar one so far have been in Hubei province. Most of the 17 victims there were elderly and suffered from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's disease and diabetes.

An 18th victim, an elderly patient, was announced on Thursday in Hebei province, near the capital, Beijing.

Wuhan's public transport lockdown came into force as of 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT), leaving normally busy train stations and airports empty.

One Wuhan resident said on social media site Weibo that people were on the ""verge of tears"" when they heard about the closures.

Health authorities are reported to have made wearing a mask mandatory in the city. They are advising people to avoid crowds and public gatherings.

Demand for rubber gloves and surgical masks has soared. Taobao, the Chinese online retail giant, has warned sellers not to profit from the outbreak by raising prices.

Also in Hubei province:

Huanggang , a city east of Wuhan, suspended bus and rail services and encouraged people not to leave the city. Cafes, cinemas, theatres and exhibitions are also being shut

A doctor at a hospital in Wuhan spoke to the BBC

The virus is now spreading at an alarming rate. The hospitals have been flooding with thousands of patients, who wait hours to see a doctor. You can imagine their panic.

Normally Wuhan is a great place to live and we are proud of our work. Specialists here have developed a guide for coronavirus diagnosis and treatment.

But I am scared because this is a new virus and the figures are worrying.

Two days ago we were told not to go to work because of the risk of contamination. If we leave our home on the hospital campus, we are required to wear masks.

I went to the supermarket to buy food, but there was nothing left, no vegetables or biscuits. Some Lunar New Year celebrations are cancelled.

People had bought tickets to go home for Lunar New Year but they can't go now. Everyone is stuck here and can't leave.

What do we know about the virus?

Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold.

Authorities have said this new virus originated in a seafood market in Wuhan that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year.

There is evidence of human-to-human transmission, with the virus spreading from patients to family members and healthcare workers.

But understanding more about how the virus transmits between people is one of the major outstanding questions.

The virus infects the lungs, and symptoms start with a fever and cough. It can progress to shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

What's the picture globally?

The World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee said on Thursday that it was not the time to declare an ""international emergency"" over the new virus, although it was ""an emergency in China"".

Its 16-member experts' panel was divided 50-50 on the issue, the WHO said, but had decided overall that it was too early because of the limited number of cases abroad, the efforts made by China to control the virus and the fact there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China.

A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound, and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola.

Authorities around the world have announced screening measures for passengers from China.

Thailand has confirmed four cases of the virus, the most outside China. The US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea have all reported one case each.

The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities

On Thursday, two more nations confirmed cases:

Singapore , where a 66-year-old man who had travelled from Wuhan is being held in an isolation room, and there is also another suspected case

Coronavirus: panic and anger in Wuhan as China orders city into lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown,01/23/20,www.theguardian.com,"A sense of panic has spread in Wuhan as the Chinese city of 11 million people was put on lockdown in an attempt to quarantine a deadly virus believed to have originated there.

On Thursday, authorities banned all transport links from the city, suspending buses, the subway system, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers.

Nearby Huanggang and Ezhou suspended buses, subways and ferries and shut the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers.

In Wuhan, supermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. Petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel amid rumours that reserves had run out. Local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks.

Few pedestrians were on the street and families cancelled plans to get together for the lunar new year holiday. Special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. Residents and all government workers are now required to wear face masks while in public spaces.

“When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough,” said Xiao, 26, a primary school teacher in Wuhan, who asked not to give her full name.

Some residents posted photos of their newly bought supplies of instant noodles and snacks on social media. “No more going out … so I won’t get sick,” wrote one person on Weibo, adding: “Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.”



Others said the lifts in their apartment complexes were being disinfected and that most of their friends and relatives in the city were also planning on staying in as much as possible.

At least 571 people have been infected with the coronavirus, which is part of the same family of viruses that gave rise to Sars. It has now reached almost all of the country’s provinces as well as the US, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong. Vietnam and Singapore confirmed their first cases on Thursday.

Chinese authorities said on Thursday that 95 patients were in critical condition.

Hong Kong officials announced on Thursday they would turn two holiday camps, including a former military barracks, into quarantine zones for people who may have come into contact with carriers of the Wuhan virus.

Seventeen people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all of them in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Many of the deaths occurred in Wuhan, where a seafood market selling wild animals is the suspected source of the virus. Scientists believe it probably jumped from an animal to a human and is now transmissible from one person to another, and could mutate further.

Quick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor? Show Hide What is Covid-19? Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.

“It’s truly an extraordinary development. You have a city of 10 million people being shut down,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science focusing on China at the University of Chicago. “In many ways the local leadership and the population are definitely not prepared. This is truly an emergency for them.”

On Thursday some residents raced to leave Wuhan before the de facto quarantine was put into effect at 10am, lining up at the airport and at train stations. Local authorities, announcing the emergency measure at around 2am on Thursday, said citizens would be notified later when the restrictions were lifted.

Anxiety has been exacerbated by reports that sick patients are being turned away from hospitals without enough room. “Infected people could be right beside you and you wouldn’t know. That is what is scarier,” said Xiao, who has not left home since Sunday.

Wuhan’s disease prevention and control centre released a statement on Thursday asking residents not to panic and not to stockpile. “At the present time, Wuhan’s reserves of food, medicine and other supplies are all enough,” it said.

Authorities have made an effort to update citizens regularly on the situation and state media have attempted to frame the current shutdown as a battle being waged by the people of Wuhan for the good of the country. The state-run People’s Daily posted on Weibo: “Come on Wuhan, let us win this disease prevention war together!”

But residents are wary of the information provided by their government, which in recent weeks repeatedly said the virus was not serious and was “controllable”.

“I am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn’t serious so no one thought it was a big deal,” said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker who described going out in large crowds on New Year’s Eve, despite the virus having been detected before then.

“Then this morning, Wuhan was suddenly sealed off. I think the government’s early warnings were not enough.”

Others criticised local authorities, who held a lunar new year banquet for 40,000 people days before authorities announced that the virus could be transmitted between humans.

“It’s been a month since the first case was discovered and only now do they think of closing the city? This Wuhan emergency response is a little slow, right?” another Weibo user wrote.

As reports circulated online that food prices had gone up in Wuhan, there were calls for government intervention. One person said: “The government needs to address this. If things become too expensive, people will definitely panic and when people feel unsafe, terrible things happen. Right now people are fighting over supplies, soon they may just be fighting.”

Authorities banned transport links from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, on Thursday morning, suspending buses, subways, ferries, and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers. Later in the day, the nearby central Chinese cities of Huanggang and Ezhou announced similar measures. Travel restrictions were also placed on the smaller cities of Chibi and Zhijiang.

Starting at midnight, long-distance buses, the rapid transit system, and the train station in Huanggang would be shut, according to a notice from the local government. Cinemas, internet cafes and other entertainment venues would all stop operating. Residents should not leave the city, except for “special reasons”.

A government notice in Ezhou said the city’s railway would stop operating on Thursday evening. In nearby Chibi, authorities said buses and rural transport links would be halted. Officials also ordered tour operators to cancel operations and said no more large-scale cultural events were to be held.

On Friday, Huangshi in Hubei province also halted public transport. The People’s Daily newspaper said Xiantao, Enshi, Qianjiang and Xianning were also subject to travel restrictions.

There have been 830 confirmed cases in China of the coronavirus, from the same family of viruses that gave rise to Sars. Chinese authorities say 95 patients remain in a critical condition.

On Thursday, Hebei’s provincial health authority said an infected patient had died, marking the first confirmed death outside Hubei province, where the outbreak began. On Friday morning the official death toll rose to 25.

Cases have also been confirmed in the US, the UK, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore.

Officials worry the weeklong lunar new year holiday, which begins on Saturday and usually sees hundreds of millions of Chinese crisscross the country, will exacerbate an outbreak that has reached almost all of China’s provinces.

The state-run Beijing News said the capital had cancelled events including two well-known lunar new year temple fairs. The Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.

The country’s railway operator, China State Railway Group, said passengers would be able to receive full refunds on tickets nationwide starting on Friday.

While sweeping measures are typical of China’s communist government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people’s liberties, and the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.

“To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,” Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization’s representative in China, told the Associated Press. “It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.”

Late on Thursday Wuhan city authorities said that limits on car travel would be introduced for the first time at noon on Friday.

In Wuhan, supermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. Petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel, exacerbated by rumours that reserves had run out. Local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks.

Anxiety in Wuhan has been exacerbated by reports that hospitals are turning patients away because they do not have enough room. A hospital contacted by the Guardian on Thursday said it had between 500 and 600 patients and recommended patients go to a community health centre instead. Eight hospitals in Wuhan put out calls for donations of protective equipment, according to Chinese media.

Officials said they would build a new hospital in six days to accommodate patients, modelled after an isolation facility constructed in Beijing during the Sars outbreak.

Hubei officials said schools, on break for the spring festival holiday, would delay the beginning of the spring term.

The illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China. The vast majority of cases in the mainland have been in the city.

Analysts have predicted the reported cases will continue to multiply. “Even if [the number of cases] are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,” Galea said. The number of cases was not an indicator of the outbreak’s severity, so long as the mortality rate remained low, he added.

The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the Sars outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome which developed from camels.

China is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of Sars. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts.

In the current outbreak, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasised that as a priority.

On Thursday a WHO committee said the outbreak does not yet constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Previous emergencies have included Ebola and Zika.

Some are even evading censors, who commonly stifle criticism of the government, to register complaints about how officials have handled the crisis.

As the death toll continued to rise, China's National Health Commission announced on Saturday nationwide measures to identify suspected cases of the deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses.

Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia must be ""immediately transported"" to a medical centre, the statement said.

In the southern city of Haikou, the city government also announced that that it would start a 14-day centralised medical observation for all tourists coming from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus.

Tourists from Hubei, especially from Wuhan city, are not allowed to leave the hotel where the medical observation will be held during the 14-day period, the announcement said.

At least 450 additional military medical staff were deployed to Hubei to help with the treatment.

Meanwhile, Australian authorities on Saturday confirmed the country's first case of the deadly infection.

In a news conference in Melbourne, Victoria's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said a Chinese man in his 50s who last week returned from China had contracted the newly identified coronavirus.

In Malaysia, the health ministry announced on Saturday that three people have been infected with the virus.

Xinhua news agency also reported one case in Nepal, involving a student from Wuhan. He reportedly arrived in Nepal on January 5 and visited the hospital on January 13.

Elsewhere, France announced late on Friday its third case of the virus - the first cases in Europe. And the United States reported its second case, involving a Chicago woman in her 60s who was hospitalised after returning from China.

Travel restrictions

A total of 18 cities in central Hubei province now have some sort of travel restrictions affecting 56 million people.

The rules include closing public transport links and access to highways in the cities, local authorities said.

In Beijing and other Chinese cities, authorities cancelled many public celebrations and other events marking the Lunar New Year, which falls on Saturday.

Hospitals in Wuhan grappled with a flood of patients and a lack of supplies.

Videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations, with some complaining their family members were turned away at hospitals that were at capacity.

Authorities in Wuhan and elsewhere put out calls for medicine, disinfection equipment, masks, goggles, gowns and other protective gear.

""I don't think this virus has been properly controlled,"" a woman in Beijing told Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler. ""I am very afraid of getting infected.""

New hospital in 10 days

Wuhan authorities said they are rapidly constructing a new hospital to deal with the crisis, to be completed by February 3.

It will be modelled on a SARS hospital that was built in Beijing in just six days during the SARS outbreak.

The seriousness of the crisis was still an open question.

It was not clear just how lethal the virus is, or even whether it is as dangerous as ordinary flu, which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the US alone.

Scientists say it is also not clear if it spreads as easily as SARS, its genetic cousin, which also originated in China and killed about 800 people in 2002-2003.

The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse. It could instead reflect better monitoring and reporting of the newly discovered virus, whose symptoms can initially resemble those of the cold and flu, including cough, fever and shortness of breath, but can worsen to pneumonia.

""It's still too early to draw conclusions about how severe the virus is because, at the beginning of any outbreak, you would focus more on the severe cases,"" said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva.

""And then maybe we are missing some mild cases because people will just be a little bit sick and will not have it tested. And they will recover.""

Tourism hit during festive season

With authorities afraid that public gatherings will hasten the spread of the virus, temples locked their doors while Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland and other major tourist destinations were closed.

People cancelled restaurant reservations before the Lunar New Year, normally a time of family reunions, sightseeing trips, fireworks displays and other festivities in the country of 1.4 billion people.

Wuhan's usually bustling streets, malls and other public spaces were quiet on the second day of its lockdown, and masks were mandatory in public.

Shoppers emptied store shelves, stocking up for what could be an extended period of isolation. Karaoke bars, movie theatres and internet cafes around the region were shut down.

While most of the deaths have been older patients, a 36-year-old man in Hubei died on Thursday.

The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or involved people who visited the city or had personal connections to those infected.

Many countries are screening travellers from China and isolating anyone with symptoms.

Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last.

Recalling the government's initial cover-up of SARS, many Chinese are suspicious of the case numbers reported by officials. Authorities have promised transparency.

China's cabinet, the State Council, announced it will be collecting information on government departments that have failed in their response to the outbreak, including ""delays, concealment and under-reporting of the epidemic"".

The state broadcaster CCTV's annual Spring Festival Gala programme, which attracted more than a billion viewers last year, paid tribute to the medical workers fighting the outbreak.

""Please believe in China,"" the hosts said. ""With the most transparent public information ... on the battlefront of the epidemic, we will definitely win.""",
Coronavirus shakes citizens' faith in Chinese government,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/coronavirus-shakes-citizens-faith-in-chinese-government,01/24/20,www.theguardian.com,"Zhu Wenyi, 21, has spent the eve of the lunar new year at home, worrying whether or not she has caught a deadly virus that has spread from her province to much of the rest of the country.

Zhu, a university student, is back in her hometown of Huangshi, one of 10 cities in Hubei province, including Wuhan, that have been locked down in an attempt to contain the virus this week. She recently stayed at a friend’s in Wuhan who later developed a fever, one of the virus’s symptoms. The friend recovered, but Zhu is still anxious.

“I’m so worried, I feel like I’m having trouble breathing,” she said. “People accuse the Wuhan government of acting too slow. It’s true, they did.”

As Chinese authorities scramble to restrict an illness that emerged a month ago, citizens are asking whether their government has failed them by failing to disclose information and not acting decisively or early enough.

Less than a week ago, officials in Wuhan, where the virus was detected, said the mystery illness posed little danger and there was no evidence it could be passed from human to human. China’s national health commission said the situation was “preventable” and “controllable”.

On Monday, the number of confirmed cases suddenly tripled and a respected scientist said the virus, believed to have originated from an animal, was now being transmitted by people. Late on Friday the official death toll in China rose to 41 with more than 1,000 confirmed cases across almost every province in China, as well as South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam.

On Friday the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three cases.

“This was most definitely not ‘preventable and controllable’… all these mistakes will be borne by the common people,” one internet user wrote on the microblog Weibo.

This weekend the cost is being felt by millions of Chinese citizens who will be isolated and nervous on the most important holiday of the year, lunar new year on 25 January. For many Chinese, especially those working in provinces far from their hometowns, it is the only time of the year they are able to go home.

Many families have cancelled plans to get together. On Friday, the hashtag “New Year’s Eve in ICU” trended on Weibo. The most liked comment in response to a state TV annual spring festival gala was: “Can you please send a responsible leader to Hubei?”

“Leaders in this country are horrible,” one Weibo user wrote, condemning Wuhan officials for attending a spring festival celebration in the middle of the outbreak.

Few issues are potent enough to threaten the Communist party’s rule in China, where the leadership under Xi Jinping enjoys broad support from the public. But people have experienced years of public health scandals from the cover-up of infant formula tainted with melamine in 2008 to last year’s discovery of hundreds of thousands of counterfeit vaccines administered to children.

The memory of China’s Sars outbreak in 2002 and 2003 has cast an especially large shadow over the current crisis. Officials initially suppressed information, worsening an outbreak of the deadly respiratory virus that went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill 744, the majority of them in China and Hong Kong.

“The coronavirus is a problem for the Chinese Communist party because the CCP has historically not handled epidemics and other large-scale disasters well,” said Maura Cunningham, a historian focusing on modern China. “The party has shown a knee-jerk tendency to clamp down on information and not be forthcoming with accurate statistics.”

Authorities have vowed this time will be different. On Monday, Xi called for “all-out prevention and control efforts” and “stressed the importance of informing the public to safeguard social stability”.

A high-level party committee posted on Wechat: “Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame.” Officials have given daily updates and Chinese media, often restricted, appear to have been given more space to report on the situation.

“The Chinese government recognises that if they don’t maintain public trust in public health, food safety … there will be a backlash, which they don’t need and don’t want,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong.

Quick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor? Show Hide What is Covid-19? Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.

But while public health officials have applauded China’s improvements since Sars, as the outbreak widens, residents, especially in Hubei, are losing faith.

“Before, I always believed what the government said. Now I don’t know who to believe,” said Xiao, 26, a teacher in Wuhan, who has been unable to leave.

Experts say that while mistakes are likely to be blamed on local officials, the virus is a test for the leadership under Xi, who has centralised decision-making even more in his consolidation of power.

“If it is stopped it reinforces Xi’s prestige and the impression that China has a system that can act and respond to crisis,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science focusing on China at the University of Chicago.

“It cuts both ways. If it is not contained, it could have an impact on the economy and could dent the legitimacy of the leadership.”

It will be a lonely Chinese new year for Zhu in Huangshi. Her family has cancelled plans to celebrate with relatives. Instead she will spend the next week scanning updates on WeChat and trying to figure out what to do if anyone in her family catches the virus. The roads have been shut down and the local hospital’s resources are limited.

“The hospital is full. There’s no way to get diagnosed. Your only option is to go to Wuhan but it’s closed off,” she said. “If you get sick, you can’t even get treated.”",
Calls for global ban on wild animal markets amid coronavirus outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/calls-for-global-ban-wild-animal-markets-amid-coronavirus-outbreak,01/24/20,www.theguardian.com,"Wild animal markets must be banned worldwide, say experts in and outside China, warning that the sale of sometimes endangered species for human consumption is the cause both of the new coronavirus outbreak and other past epidemics.

The Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which has been closed down as the source of the infection, had a wild animal section, where live and slaughtered species were on sale. An inventory list at the Da Zhong domestic and wild animals shop inside the market includes live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions, bamboo rats, squirrels, foxes, civets, hedgehogs (probably porcupines), salamanders, turtles and crocodiles. In addition, it offered assorted parts of some animals, such as crocodile tail, belly, tongue and intestines.

After Sars – the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-3 caused by a very similar coronavirus to the one currently in China – there was a temporary ban on the wild animal markets. Chinese scientists wrote papers on the risks of allowing people to trade and eat wild meat.

But the markets are operating again and are widespread across China, Vietnam and other parts of south-east Asia, said Prof Diana Bell from the University of East Anglia’s School of Biological Sciences.

“There has been a long discussion among many stakeholders highlighting this risk,” she told the Guardian.

Ebola came from monkeys, infected by bats and eaten in the African bush by people in very poor villages. But in China, wild animal meat is not cheap. “These have now become luxury items,” said Bell. “It’s a perfect storm. There is a shift from subsistence hunting to feed your family – that might make your family sick but it doesn’t go anywhere else. Now, these animals are being sold into a multibillion pound illegal trade, right up there with drugs. They cost more than livestock.

“People who are interviewed say they prefer wild meat. Rich businessmen will take their colleagues to wildlife restaurants.”

Although the coronaviruses behind both Sars and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were traced eventually to bats, Bell says bats are not necessarily the source of the new virus. “It’s just that bats have been quite well studied,” she said.

“An obvious candidate is wild rodent [such as bamboo rat] in the market. Hygiene levels are poor. They are cutting the throats of animals in front of people, so there will be a lot of blood everywhere. Don’t think these wild animals are being fed, but they might opportunistically be feeding on rodents in the market.”

Man’s destruction of the habitat of many wild species may be partly responsible, she added. Forests and other habitats are being cleared. Species that survive are moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.

In a paper published by the Royal Society in 2004, Bell wrote with colleagues: “A major lesson from Sars is that the underlying roots of newly emergent zoonotic diseases may lie in the parallel bio-diversity crisis of massive species loss as a result of overexploitation of wild animal populations and the destruction of their natural habitats by increasing human populations.”

It is time to end the wildlife markets, said Bell. “The Chinese and surrounding countries need to make it a priority to reduce demand and reduce supply and close the wet markets down. How many warning shots do we need?

“People need to stop eating wildlife. The younger generation is already on board and various high-profile Chinese people have been saying it. It is the older generation. These markets are all over China and in Vietnam. It is not just Wuhan.”

Chinese scientists are also highlighting the problem. Zhang Jinshuo of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was one of those who took part in the investigations into the source of Sars in 2003.

“We later published many papers and popular science articles, urging everyone to stop eating wild animals and not to have too close contact with wild animals. Only the health of wild animals and the health of ecosystems can [secure] human health,” he was reported as saying on the website of Pro-Med, the international society for infectious diseases.

The Wildlife Conservation Society is also calling for the closure of live animal markets that sell wildlife for human consumption. It called on governments to recognise them as a global public health threat and to strengthen enforcement against trafficking.

“If these markets persist, and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife persists, then the public will continue to face heightened risks from emerging new viruses, potentially more lethal, and the source of future pandemic spread,” said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the WCS health programme.

“Poorly regulated live animal markets, where wild animals, farmed wildlife, and domestic animals are transported from across the regions and housed together to sell for human consumption provide ideal conditions for the emergence of new viruses that threaten human health, economic stability, and ecosystem health.”",
China's Omnivorous Markets Are in the Eye of a Lethal Outbreak Once Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html,01/25/20,www.nytimes.com,"The Wildlife Conservation Society, an advocacy organization based in New York, called for a global ban on the commercial sale of wildlife, especially in markets like those in China, saying that the latest outbreak proved the public health threat.

Christian Walzer, the organization’s executive director of health, said that the astonishing diversity of wild animals in markets like these, packed in small cages in crowded market stalls, created a perfect laboratory for the unintentional incubation of new viruses that can enter human cells. Viruses can be spread through saliva, blood or feces.

“Each animal is a package of pathogens,” he said in a telephone interview.

But some Chinese consumers ascribe traditional medicinal benefits to the animals. Vendors and even officials in state news media have touted wildlife as alternative sources of protein and sources of revenue in impoverished regions.

An article by the Xinhua news agency last fall, for example, said that farming bamboo rats was helping to lift people out of poverty in Guangxi, another southern province.

Worries about meat supplies surged last year over the outbreak of African swine fever, which led to the killing of 40 percent of the country’s pigs. Production of domesticated livestock on the country’s farms is, compared to the sale of wildlife, subjected to far more regulation and inspection. Outbreaks still occur, but they are identified more quickly.

Part of the problem with the wildlife trade is that there is far less regulation, despite the greater risk of live animals’ infecting each other and people, especially in markets that can be unsanitary.

Mr. Walzer said that one problem with the legal production of some species is that it can blur the lines between those raised in captivity and those captured in the wild, where unknown viruses have existed for years without contact with humans.",
Coronavirus: Hubei cities fearful as medical supplies run low,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/hubei-cities-fearful-china-virus-medical-supplies-run-200126034425456.html,01/25/20,www.aljazeera.com,"Beijing, China - As China scrambles to cope with its worst public health crisis since the SARS outbreak in 2003, people living in cities near Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, fear they are at increasing risk because hospitals and clinics do not have the resources needed to identify and treat those infected.

""We already ran out of protective suits a few days ago, and now we are using disposable raincoats to offer minimum protection,"" a doctor at Xiaogan First People's hospital in Hubei, who preferred not to be named, told Al Jazeera.

""Please help us spread the word. We don't know how long we can last.""

More:

Xiaogan lies about 73 kilometres (45 miles) northwest of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei.

Even in Wuhan, where supplies are being sent and an emergency hospital is under construction, doctors say they are under-resourced and the hospitals designated to treat coronavirus patients have been dangerously packed for days.

Some have asked for donations from the general public and, thanks to campaigns via GoFundMe, Weibo, and WeChat, medical supplies are being sent from all over China to Hubei province - almost all are directed to Wuhan.

In the 13 municipalities outside Wuhan, unease is growing - that people are faced with an outbreak they do not have the resources to handle.

'Please help us!'

Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, provided work for many people coming from other cities in the province.

Before the city was sealed off on January 23, many of these people had already returned to their hometowns to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and there are concerns they might have unwittingly brought the virus with them.

""Please don't forget about us! Hubei doesn't only have Wuhan,"" one netizen wrote on Weibo, China's popular microblogging platform. ""We need supplies! Please help us!""

In Xiangyang, the third-largest city in Hubei and home to more than five million people, there were zero confirmed cases as of January 25, but that has not brought any relief.

""There are no hospitals in Xiangyang that have the diagnostic kit and can provide diagnosis,"" Yixin Yu, a resident of Xiangyang told Al Jazeera. ""The most likely diagnosis you get is viral pneumonia and will be asked to go back home to exercise self-quarantine.""

""It can't be that there are no infected people - it's only that no case is being confirmed,"" Yu added. Xiangyang is about 300 kilometres (186 miles) northwest of Wuhan.

The media office of the Xiangyang Local Health Commission told Al Jazeera that despite intensified efforts to try and diagnose patients and treat accordingly, local clinics and hospitals were overcrowded and there was a severe shortage of medical resources.

""We are aware of the situation in local hospitals,"" the director of the office told Al Jazeera in a phone interview. ""We have liaised with our superiors and requested more diagnostic kits. We hope to get our hands on them as soon as possible.""

One of the biggest concerns across the province is that doctors cannot confirm an infection, or take necessary action, without the kit.

Some residents from cities outside Wuhan fear that means the number of cases is much higher than officially reported because of local hospitals' inability to officially diagnose the infection.

Shortage of masks, goggles, suits

In Xiaogan, also home to five million people, patients reported that only the most severe suspected cases were referred for the diagnostic test and the rest were told to isolate themselves at home, leaving them at risk of developing the disease, spreading the virus and becoming even sicker.

""If you die alone at home, then you won't go on record and no one will know that you died from the coronavirus,"" one patient said during an interview with China's nationally circulated weekly magazine, Sanlian.

More than a dozen cities in Hubei province have been sealed off to varying degrees, restricting the movement of more than 50 million people. That means that if there is no way to confirm a diagnosis in a provincial city, there is also no way to get a diagnosis anywhere else.

Apart from the difficulty in securing the supply of diagnostic devices, local hospitals have also said there is an urgent shortage of medical masks, goggles, gloves, and protective suits.

In Xiaogan, some doctors and nurses say they have been battling the deadly virus without any effective protective gear.

The doctor from Xiaogan First People's Hospital said some of her colleagues had to tear apart transparent plastic file bags to cover their heads because there was no longer a supply of medical protective goggles.

In Jingzhou, about 220 kilometres (137 miles) west of Wuhan, doctors say they are also grappling with shortages.

""I can't go and use the bathroom because every time I go, I'd have to change the protective suit and I call myself lucky that I have this one that I'm wearing already,"" Lu, a doctor at Jingzhou Central Hospital, said.

Given the lack of supplies, some medical equipment manufacturing factories have summoned staff back to work during Lunar New Year.

Medical staff say the need is urgent.

Yuan, head of the department of public health at Qichun People's hospital located at Huanggang, said they had solicited public donations of N95 respirator masks, goggles, medical gloves, and protective gear.

""Our resources are incredibly stretched, especially when Wuhan is taking priority over us,"" Yuan said. ""But of course, we understand that because Wuhan, after all, is taking the hardest hit.""",
China says coronavirus can spread before symptoms show -- calling into question US containment strategy,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/26/health/coronavirus-spread-symptoms-chinese-officials/index.html,01/26/20,edition.cnn.com,"(CNN) China's health minister Ma Xiaowei made a startling statement Sunday about the Wuhan coronavirus: He said people can spread it before they become symptomatic.

""This is a game changer,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's much harder to contain a virus -- to track down a patient's contacts and quarantine them immediately -- if the patient was spreading the disease for days or weeks before they even realized they had it.

""It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought,"" said Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""This is worse than we anticipated.""

Ma didn't explain why he thinks the virus can be spread before someone has symptoms. If the Chinese health minister is right -- and there are those who doubt him -- that means the five confirmed cases in the United States might have been infectious while traveling from Wuhan to Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington state, even if they had no symptoms at the time.

On Sunday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the risk to the American public for contracting this virus continues to be low.

""We at CDC don't have clear evidence that patients are infectious before symptom onset, but we are actively investigating that possibility,"" Messonnier said.

""We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I continue to hope that it is not,"" she added.

The Wuhan coronavirus has killed more than 50 people in China and infected thousands there, and spread as far as the US, France and Canada.

'We're going to have to reevaluate our strategy'

US health officials believe the Wuhan virus has an incubation period of about two weeks, CDC officials said Friday during a media briefing.

""Based on what we know now about this virus, our concern for transmission before symptoms develop is low, so that is reassuring,"" Dr. Jennifer Layden, an epidemiologist with the Illinois Department of Health, said at the Friday briefing.

The update on Sunday from the Chinese health minister should encourage health officials to change that thinking, some infectious disease experts told CNN.

""Assuming that Ma is correct, we're going to have to re-evaluate our strategy, that's for sure,"" Schaffner said.

Dr. Paul Offit, another longtime CDC adviser, said given Ma's news, he thinks health officials should alert people on the flights that the three US patients took from Wuhan that they might have traveled with someone who was infectious.

""I think the conservative thing to do would be to cast a wider net,"" he said.

NIH doctor wants US to inspect Chinese data

The United States' top infectious disease doctor wants a team of CDC disease detectives to go to China and check on these crucial questions about how the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading.

But there's something stopping them: China first has to invite the CDC.

""Up to now, to my knowledge, we have not been invited,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health, said Sunday.

NIH and CDC are separate divisions of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

The implications of Ma's statement that the coronavirus is transmissible before symptoms are so important ""that in my mind it's absolutely critical that we ourselves see the data, because what goes on over there has implications for what happens here,"" Fauci said.

He added that to his knowledge, the Chinese did not tell US health authorities that the virus could spread before someone is symptomatic, a crucial aspect of any disease investigation. He said he learned about it after reading a CNN reporter's email.

Fauci said that CDC disease detectives would need to see precisely how Chinese health authorities have gathered their data and how they came to their conclusion.

""To my knowledge, we have not seen the precise minute, granular data and how they collected it,"" he said. ""We need to get to the real bottom line of how they collected their data and see if it's valid.""

""The Chinese have good people. I don't want to impugn their capabilities,"" Fauci added. ""But when it's something as important as this, our people who are trained epidemiologists need to go over their data and the best way to do that is go there and see how they're collecting it.""

CDC's Messonnier said Sunday the CDC has staff in China, but the team is not directly involved in the Wuhan coronavirus response. The agency hopes to have ""additional engagement"" on the outbreak in China in the coming days, she said.

In a tweet on Sunday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""I am on my way to Beijing, [China] to meet with the Government & health experts supporting the #coronavirus response. My @WHO colleagues & I would like to understand the latest developments & strengthen our partnership with [China] in providing further protection against the outbreak.""

Are Chinese officials right?

In a fast-spreading, evolving outbreak like this one, information often changes.

Some experts are skeptical because of the lack of data from China.

""I seriously doubt that the Chinese public officials have any data supporting this statement,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""I know of no evidence in 17 years of working with coronaviruses -- SARS and MERS -- where anyone has been found to be infectious during their incubation period.""

Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome are both caused by coronaviruses. While each has killed hundreds of people worldwide, together they amounted to only a handful of cases and no deaths in the United States.

Offit, on the other hand, said it wouldn't surprise him if the Chinese health minister is right and the Wuhan coronavirus can be spread while people are asymptomatic. Measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox all spread that way, he said.

Despite that, he said he's optimistic that the US can control the outbreak before it gets out of hand, as it has in China.

That's because the spread of the outbreak doesn't just rely on the time period of contagiousness. It also relies on how easily the virus spreads. Some viruses,such as measles, spread easily even to people on the other side of a room. Other viruses spread only with much closer contact.

""My gut says we're going to be able to contain this real quick -- we're going to be able to put a moat around this fire,"" said Offit, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""I think this is going to be much more like SARS or MERS than the movie 'Contagion.' ""

""But then,"" the Philadelphia-based doctor said, ""I'm an Eagles fan, so I tend to be optimistic about things.""",
Saudi Arabia tries to calm oil market over coronavirus fears,https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/saudi-arabia-calm-oil-market-coronavirus-fears-200127133236911.html,01/27/20,www.aljazeera.com,"Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, on Monday urged caution against ""gloomy expectations"" regarding the possible impact of the spread of the new coronavirus on the global economy and oil demand.

The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China rose to 81 on Monday with more than 2,700 infected, as health authorities around the world stepped up screening of passengers from China.

More:

Crude prices fell about 3 percent on Monday as the rising number of cases of the coronavirus and China's city lockdowns and extension of its Lunar New Year holiday deepened concerns over oil demand.

Oil prices had already been weighed down by oversupply and slowing demand from China. Last week, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group said the coronavirus could cause global oil demand to slip by 260,000 barrels a day, with jet fuel accounting for some two-thirds of that drop.

But Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the impact being seen on oil and other markets was ""primarily driven by psychological factors and extremely negative expectations adopted by some market participants despite its very limited impact on global oil demand"".

""Such extreme pessimism occurred back in 2003 during the SARS outbreak, though it did not cause a significant reduction in oil demand,"" the minister said in a statement.

Fellow Gulf OPEC oil producer United Arab Emirates echoed the Saudi minister's comments.

""It is important that we do not exaggerate projections related to future decreases in oil demand due to events in China,"" UAE Minister of Energy Suhail al-Mazrouei said.

In March ""OPEC and OPEC+ member countries will discuss market conditions and, if required, all options to ensure continued market balance,"" he said.

The Saudi minister said OPEC and its allies could respond to any impact on the oil market, adding he was confident the Chinese and international authorities could contain the virus.

Brent crude was down 3.1 percent at $58.82 at 1312 GMT, having earlier dropped to $58.68. US crude was down by 2.8 percent at $52.68, having earlier eased to $52.15. Both hit their lowest levels since October.

Prince Abdulaziz said he was confident the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, a group known as OPEC+, ""have the capability and flexibility needed to respond to any developments"".

Oman's oil minister told Reuters news agency on Monday that he fully supported Saudi Arabia's readiness to react to any impact the virus has on the market.

OPEC+, which includes Russia, has been reducing oil supply to support prices and has agreed to hold back 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of output until the end of March.

Prince Abdulaziz said all options would be open when OPEC+ meets in Vienna in March.

An OPEC source said on Monday that there were ""preliminary discussions"" among OPEC+ for an extension of the current oil supply cuts beyond March, and a possible deeper cut was also an option, if there was a need, and if the China virus spread impacted oil demand.",
Oil prices have fallen 10% as coronavirus raises fears for global growth,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/27/business/oil-prices-coronavirus/index.html,01/27/20,edition.cnn.com,"London (CNN Business) China's coronavirus outbreak has rattled oil markets, sending prices sharply lower as investors worry that efforts to prevent it spreading will harm the country's economy and reduce demand for crude.

Brent crude futures traded around 3% lower on Monday at $58.88 a barrel, their lowest level since October. US crude futures were down roughly 3%.

The price of Brent, the global benchmark, has tumbled by about 10% since January 17, when Chinese authorities confirmed the death of a second person infected with the virus. It has spread rapidly since then, leading the Chinese government to impose restrictions on transportation. Full, or partial lockdowns, are in effect in 15 Chinese cities, covering 60 million people.

The death toll now stands at 80, with nearly 3,000 confirmed cases in mainland China and more than 50 in other places including the United States.

""As the human cost continues to rise, investors have become increasingly concerned about the potential economic consequences of the disease,"" analysts at Rabobank said in a research note.

The number of people killed in China by the new coronavirus has risen to 82, with almost 3,000 confirmed ill.

The national new year holiday has been extended by three days to Sunday, in an attempt to contain the spread.

The number of deaths in Hubei rose from 56 to 76, with six deaths elsewhere. Wuhan is in lockdown and several other cities have imposed travel bans.

At least 44 cases have been confirmed abroad, including in Germany, the United States, and Australia.

There have been no deaths outside China.

On Monday, authorities in Beijing confirmed a 50-year-old man had died - the first fatality in the Chinese capital from the virus.

In Shanghai, the government has stopped businesses from returning to work until 10 February. The ban applies to all companies apart from utilities, medical firms, medical suppliers, and supermarkets.

Meanwhile, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is in Beijing to discuss the outbreak with the Chinese government and health experts.

The BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai says extending the main holiday of the year is a highly unusual move. But after the pre-new year travel surge, the prospect of half a billion people getting back on trains, planes and buses and criss-crossing the country again is the last thing the government wants, he adds.

On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and centre of the outbreak.

Experts suspect many more people are infected, but actual figures are hard to ascertain due to a number of factors like some people being asymptomatic.

Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, London, told the UK's Guardian newspaper his ""best guess"" put the number at 100,000 infected, while figures put together by the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong suggest the number was closer to 43,000.

However, the University of Hong Kong research also suggested that - without public health intervention - tens of thousands more could be infected every day when the outbreak reaches its height. As a result of their projections, Gabriel Leung, the dean of the faculty of Medicine, was advising ""substantial, draconian measures"" to limit population mobility.

The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine.

Most of the deaths have been of elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems.

What is happening in Wuhan?

Travel from the city, home to 11 million people, has been severely restricted and non-essential vehicles have been banned from the roads.

At the Hubei border, workers are checking people's temperatures before allowing them into the province.

The local government in Wuhan said no-one from the city had left China in the past four days. Some 4,096 tourists from Wuhan are still out of the country, while five million new year travellers left the city before the lockdown.

More than half a million medical staff have joined the province's prevention, control and treatment operations, while two makeshift hospitals are being built.

What is the situation in China?

New year celebrations were scaled back and four major cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Tianjin - have banned long-distance buses.

Schools and official institutions will remain closed for the rest of this week.

Beijing has closed the Forbidden City for tourists, as well as a section of the Great Wall. Both Disney parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai have closed.

In Guangdong province, several cities have made face masks mandatory in public.

Hong Kong, which has eight confirmed cases, has declared a city-wide emergency, with schools closed until 17 February. Mongolia - which has yet to record a case of the virus - has closed its border with China. It has also closed schools until 2 March, and banned public events.

Meanwhile, He Qinghua, a top official with China's National Health Commission, told reporters some areas still ""lack determination in controlling the epidemic"", according to the state-run newspaper Global Times. He said rural villages, in particular, were failing to deal with the crisis ""in a timely manner"".

Over the weekend, Chinese officials warned the virus was able to spread during its incubation period, believed to be between one and 14 days, making it harder to contain the illness.

What is the situation internationally?

According to the World Health Organization and national authorities, there have been at least 47 confirmed cases outside China.

The latest case to be confirmed is in the German state of Bavaria, only the fourth so far in Europe.

Eight cases: Thailand

Thailand Five: USA, Australia, Singapore

USA, Australia, Singapore Four: Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea

Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea Three: France, Japan

France, Japan Two: Vietnam

Vietnam One: Nepal, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Germany

In the UK, 73 people have been tested - but no-one has resulted to have contracted the virus.

Almost all had recently been to Wuhan or had been in close contact with someone who had.

Where did the virus emerge?

The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.

Authorities have since temporarily banned the sale of all wildlife in China. The virus itself is a new, or ""novel"" coronavirus - a family that normally affects animals.

'As long as we leave, they don't mind'

Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hubei / Henan

Image caption A worker checking the BBC team's temperature

Police and officials in the impact zone in Hubei and Henan provinces are now very keen to move us on wherever we arrive.

They don't seem to mind where we go - as long as we leave their towns.

We explain that the world wants to see the important, tiring work they're doing to combat the virus. But they're not interested. It could be that they're worried that our presence might imply to some that their patch is not handling this emergency well enough.

One police officer at the entrance to a small town in Henan said to me: ""We don't have a problem here any more so there's no need for you to be here.""

He said this at a checking station as cars were being pulled up behind him. Medical staff covered head to toe in protective clothing were then screening every passenger.

They also checked the inside of all vehicles. I'm not sure what they were looking for - but it certainly didn't look like business as usual.

What can people do to stay safe?

The World Health Organization (WHO) advises its ""standard recommendations"" focusing on ""hand and respiratory hygiene"".

That essentially means washing hands or using disinfectants, and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

The advice also suggests avoiding contact with live animals in places where there have been coronavirus cases, and not to eat raw or uncooked animal products.

Coronavirus: Foreign Office warns against 'all but essential travel' to China,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51288672,01/28/20,www.bbc.com,"Image copyright AFP/Getty

The Foreign Office is warning Britons not to travel to mainland China, unless their journey is essential.

It comes as Britons in Hubei Province, at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, prepare to be flown home as early as Thursday.

The virus has caused more than 100 deaths, spreading across China and to at least 16 other countries.

There have been no confirmed cases in the UK so far, with 97 people testing negative for the virus.

The FCO had already warned against all travel to Hubei Province, saying anyone there who could leave should do so.

Its new advice warns against ""all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao)"".

It warns the Chinese government is imposing further restrictions on movement, adding: ""It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so.""

The FCO is arranging to evacuate Britons from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, urging those who want to leave to contact the British consulate before 11:00 local time on Wednesday.

Up to 300 British people are thought to be in the area, which is now under strict travel restrictions. Officials estimate as many as 200 of them will want to return to the UK.

One teacher in Wuhan, the capital city of the province, told the Press Association UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights - with some understood to be scheduled to fly back on Thursday morning.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wuhan is in lockdown, with travel out of the city restricted

'Cities could be closed at short notice'

Travel journalist Simon Calder told BBC News the FCO's change of advice was ""extremely significant"".

""My estimate is that there are around 10,000 holidaymakers in China at the moment and many thousands more who are on business or living as expatriates,"" he said.

""The Foreign Office is being clear that it is not overly concerned with people who are there at the moment, it is more that they want to manage the scale of any possible problems.

""At the moment people can fly freely in and out of Beijing and Shanghai - the Foreign Office appears to be concerned that cities like that could be closed at short notice.""

Mr Calder said airlines flying from the UK to China ""have all said that they will provide refunds and anyone booked on a package holiday due to depart imminently will be entitled to a full refund"".

Those with packages booked to depart beyond the next week or so may be told to wait and see by their travel company, in case the FCO changes its advice.

""Anyone who travels to China against the Foreign Office advice risks invalidating their insurance,"" he added.

Amie Keeley, head of news at Travel Weekly, said it was a quiet time for organised tours in China, but operators had been offering customers with bookings later in the year refunds or alternative travel dates.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was ""working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei Province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated"".

Britons have also been advised by the FCO to ""comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities"".

British Airways said it was assessing its schedule of flights to China, while Virgin Atlantic said its flights to Shanghai woud continue to operate as usual.

A UK expert developing a vaccine against the virus has said it has a ""very good chance"" of being effective.

Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said he plans to start testing the vaccine on animals by the middle of February, with human studies in the summer if enough funding is secured.

Britons in parts of China affected by the virus have been criticising the UK government for not doing enough to help them leave.

Some in Wuhan said they had been given little information, compared with those from other countries. The US and Japan have been sending planes to Wuhan to evacuate their citizens.

Meanwhile, tests on people who have returned to the UK from the area are continuing.

One man currently being tested was filmed as he left home in Harborne, Birmingham, on Monday, on his way to hospital.

A video posted on Twitter by a neighbour showed him being escorted to an ambulance by a medic wearing a protective suit.

Earlier, Public Health England in the West Midlands said blood tests on the man were ongoing but it later said it was not in a position to comment on individual cases and would not provide rolling updates on tests.

It said testing for coronavirus involved taking samples from the patient's nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and sending them to a laboratory which could provide a result within 24 hours.

Coronavirus Crisis Exposes Cracks in China's Facade of Unity,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/china-coronavirus-communist-party.html,01/28/20,www.nytimes.com,"From the outside, China’s Communist Party appears powerful and effective. It has tightened its control over Chinese politics and culture, the economy and everyday life, projecting the image of a gradually unifying society.

The coronavirus outbreak has blown up that facade.

Staff members at prestigious Union Hospital in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, have joined others around China in begging online for medical supplies. Videos show patients in Wuhan beseeching medical staff for treatment. Residents of Wuhan and its province, Hubei, are being chased off planes and ousted from hotels and villages.

Online critics are comparing current leaders unfavorably with past ones, even though the older generation had its own tarnished record on responding to emergencies. Some people have urged local party officials to kill themselves.

As cracks show in China’s veneer of stability, even some with ties to the party leadership are calling for those in power to shine light on divisions rather than papering them over. The crisis has shown that China remains riddled with vulnerabilities that no amount of censorship or strong-arming can hide.",

The concern is that the fallout could create a major shock for markets, even as worries about geopolitics and global trade have eased.

Many Asian stock markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, but those that were open, including Japan’s and South Korea’s, fell and futures trading in China slumped. Money poured into safe-haven assets like gold and pushed up the value of the United States dollar. Most European markets were slightly higher.

Japan’s minister of economic and fiscal policy said on Tuesday that the Chinese outbreak would affect the Japanese tourism industry and warned that it could also hurt exports and corporate profits. Chinese tourists traveling to Japan accounted for 30 percent of all tourists in 2019, he said at a news conference.

“There are concerns over the impact to the Chinese and global economy from the spread of infection in China, transportation disruptions, cancellation of group tours from China and an extension in the Lunar holiday,” said the minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura.",

Airlines are taking action as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread. The virus has killed 132 people and infected over 6,000 people in China so far, with dozens more cases confirmed in places such as the United States, Japan, Germany and France.

International Airlines Group ICAGY British Airways, which is owned by, said Wednesday that it has suspended all direct flights between Britain and China with immediate effect after the UK Foreign Office warned against all but essential travel to China.

The carrier operates two daily direct flights from London to China — one to Beijing (PKX) and one to Shanghai (PVG). The airline said it had suspended the flights until January 31 while it assesses the situation, but they were unavailable to book online through February 29. Passengers can still book BA flights to mainland China via connections in cities such as Hong Kong.

Diary of a Wuhan native: A week under coronavirus quarantine,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/diary-wuhan-native-week-coronavirus-quarantine-200131045152448.html,01/30/20,www.aljazeera.com,"At least nine million people in Wuhan were put under quarantine on January 23 after the authorities decided to seal off the entire city. The order was later expanded to the entire Hubei province, affecting nearly 56 million people. Now a week has passed. What does Wuhan look like under quarantine? How has the city's population been handling it?

I have been in touch with a few local residents since the beginning of this outbreak, and here is one of the stories of all those people living in the epicentre of this epidemic. The storyteller is a teacher. He has requested to remain anonymous.

Story as told to Shawn Yuan on January 30

My city has been ill for over a month now, and it has been sealed off for a week. Millions of us have been put under quarantine for seven days now, and all of this still feels surreal.

These days, I have been doing the same things over and over again: eat, sleep, eat, and the cycle continues.

All entertainment shows have also been cancelled by the government, and that leaves only the news about the virus playing on a loop on TV. Every aspect of my life is constantly reminding me of a single fact - the virus outbreak is still very real.

Last night, I looked outside of the window of my apartment - absolutely empty streets, eerily quiet neighbourhood, some flickering streetlights, and one giant LED screen playing the public service announcement, advising people to stay indoors. All of this almost feels like a scene out of a zombie movie.

I try to distract myself and keep my mind fresh: I read books, I make podcasts, I watch films, trying my best to make sure this whole mess doesn't get me. But sometimes, in this repetitive daily routine, we start to forget what we used to and aspire to be. This epidemic has taken a toll on all of us.

The memory of waking up to a city completely sealed off remains fresh. ""Dumbstruck"" is probably the best word to describe how I felt. This had never happened - not in my life, not in my parents'.

Fear and anxiety

Having seen what the SARS outbreak did, this still is the first time we all became nervous. That's also when I realised the situation had gone way beyond what the official facade looked like. In the first days following the lockdown, I was overwhelmed, but more afraid, I guess.

The morning of the lockdown, many private cars were trying to get out of Wuhan. But all my family is in Wuhan and it made no sense for me to leave. Instead, I rushed out to get more masks, but at that time, the supply for masks had already dwindled significantly - many pharmacies had run out of them. That's when I first started to freak out - what if I couldn't get them? What if I or someone in my family got infected?

Luckily, I managed to get some after a few tries in different pharmacies. And that was the last day I was out of my house for more than one hour during a day. Almost hourly anxiety took over me during these past seven days.

I went out yesterday to go to a supermarket. Food was running out at home, but also because I really needed to get out. I was going crazy - it's ironic that when I was working, I always wanted to stay at home and rest, but now that I am spending almost my entire time at home, it feels like torture.

Luckily, food is still readily available, and the price wasn't ridiculous, either. There were a lot more people than I expected at the supermarkets. Waiting outside of the market to get temperature checked and using hand sanitiser before going in have become the requirement for all the markets.

'Eerily empty neighbourhood'

Yesterday I saw the video of people singing the national anthem and shouting from their homes to each other to keep the morale high.

""Add oil! You can do this!"" It really made me smile and want to cry at the same time. It's a tough time but I have always thought Wuhan is a place full of potential and energy.

Today is the fifth day of the Chinese New Year, so according to traditions, we are supposed to go to temples and pay tribute to the God of Wealth today. Most of the businesses should be open today, too. But I took a walk around my neighbourhood this morning - just like the past seven days, it's empty - eerily empty. But at least the weather is getting better.

I took a photo of my dad today standing on the pavement of a park. His quarantine life, like so many others, has been eating and sleeping and eating again. No friends to talk to, no relatives to visit, and no TV programmes that he loved to watch nowadays. The only little ""entertainment"" for him is to take a look at this empty road and do nothing.

Whenever I get bored and start thinking, which happens quite often these days, the feeling of anger started to boil inside of me - why did this local government keep hiding the truth and even arresting the eight people who initially shared the information?

I had already known the situation wasn't as rosy as pictured by the government at that time, but I never for a second thought the scale of the crisis had reached a level to warrant a city-wide lockdown.

'An incredibly difficult time'

The Lunar New Year couldn't have come at a worse time, either. My family had already planned some trips during the week, and we're supposed to go to my grandmother's. Of course, all of this has been cancelled, but the thought of what this could have been is making what this ended up being even more unbearable.

On New Year's Eve, my dad went to sleep early because the Lunar New Year has been ruined - no visiting family, no drinking with them, no entertainment, but more importantly, a constant fear looming the entire family and the city.

I saw him turning off the light before 10pm - this is the first time I saw him turning off lights on New Year's Eve. He always told me that we should leave one light on for New Year's Eve. I guess a new year like this has made him forget about all the rituals.

The gala hosted by China's state television angered me even more. The entire country was struggling to cope with the virus outbreak and thousands of people were getting infected in Wuhan alone. But there was almost no mention of Wuhan during the gala except for poetry recitation.

""Wang Qiang defeated Serena Williams during the Australian Open, so that means we can defeat anything,"" one host said.

Wuhan Yangtze River Tunnel is blocked with a barrier following an outbreak of the new coronavirus and the city's lockdown, in Wuhan on Saturday, January 25 [File: China Daily via Reuters]

That only made me angrier - their response to how we are going to defeat the outbreak is this completely unrelated analogy? I guess, after this crisis, people's trust towards the ""Big Brother"" will be more fragile.

It's an incredibly difficult time for this city, but I'm so very proud of my city: everyone is trying their best to make sure the city continues to operate as normal - something we desperately need right now.

But still, Wuhan will be forever changed, and now we are just anxiously waiting for the epidemic to end so we can start getting used to whatever the shape new life will take.

Years or even decades from now, how are we supposed to tell this story to our next generation? Can we really realise what it means to be a ""citizen"" of the society?

The only thing I hope now is that our generation doesn't fail the next. At least I know I will keep this memory fresh.",
Coronavirus may disrupt India's smartphone production,https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/coronavirus-disrupt-india-smartphone-production-200130201710771.html,01/30/20,www.aljazeera.com,"The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could start to disrupt India's production of smartphones if it continues to spread in February, industry executives said. They warn it could delay component shipments.

India is the world's biggest smartphone maker after China but is still largely dependent on China for supplies of parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards.

More:

Taiwan's Foxconn and Wistron make iPhones in India for Apple, and Foxconn produces phones there for China's Xiaomi as well. Other smartphone makers in India include South Korea's Samsung and China's OnePlus.

So far, smartphone makers in India have weathered the impact of the virus, which has already killed 170 people, partly because they had ramped up inventories of Chinese-made parts anyway to cover the Lunar New Year holiday period when China's factories close down.

""Those disruptions were already planned, but if it [the virus's spread] gets prolonged, then for March and April production, we will have serious trouble,"" said S N Rai, the cofounder of homegrown smartphone maker Lava. ""We're definitely worried about it.""

Some components can be shipped in from markets such as South Korea, Vietnam or Taiwan, but smartphone makers will only make such purchases as a ""last resort"" as it would force companies to make changes, including in design and software, Rai said.

China's OnePlus said its Indian operations could manage, in the short term, at least.

""We are well covered because we have the entire production in India, we already have enough stock, and even going forward many of the components will anyway be coming directly from other markets,"" said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus.

While Beijing has expressed confidence in defeating the ""devil"" virus - which on Thursday was declared a health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization - major companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Sweden's IKEA have closed operations in China.

India's Tata Motors, which counts China as a major market for its luxury Jaguar Land Rover cars, said on Thursday that it was worried about the coronavirus and warned that the outbreak could hit profits.

As several airlines suspend flights to China, the movement of technical staff from the country (on-site support executives and machine and automation specialists, among others) will also be curtailed, and that will hit India's smartphone sector, said an executive at another foreign-owned smartphone maker, who did not wish to be named.

For now, the industry just hopes the outbreak can be contained within the next two weeks.

""If the problem persists beyond February 10, 2020, then we have a real problem at hand,"" said Pankaj Mohindroo, head of the India Cellular & Electronics Association, an industry lobby group.",
Coronavirus vaccine: Scientists race to develop prevention,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51299735,01/30/20,www.bbc.com,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine

A deadly new virus. Thousands of people infected. No cure. No vaccine.

We've been here many times before.

In the past five years alone, the world has faced outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, another coronavirus called Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and now the virus simply known as ""2019-nCoV"".

It's already infected thousands of people and killed more than 100.

But unlike in many previous outbreaks, where vaccines to protect people have taken years to develop, research for a vaccine to help stem this outbreak got under way within hours of the virus being identified.

Chinese officials released its genetic code very quickly. That information helps scientists determine where the virus probably came from, how it might mutate as the outbreak develops, and how to protect people against it.

With technological advances and greater commitment from governments around the world to fund research on emerging diseases, research facilities were able to spring into action fast.

Unprecedented speed

At Inovio's lab in San Diego, scientists are using a relatively new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine. ""INO-4800"" - as it's currently called - with plans for it to enter human trials by the early summer.

Kate Broderick, senior vice-president of research and development at Inovio, said: ""Once China had provided the DNA sequence of this virus, we were able to put it through our lab's computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours.

""Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specific parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to.

""We then use the patient's own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the body's own natural response mechanisms.""

Image caption Scientists hope to have a vaccine ready to enter human trial by early summer

Inovio says if the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China ""by the end of the year"".

It is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. But if Inovio's timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation.

The last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in 2002 - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over.

The work in these labs is being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is made up of and funded by governments and philanthropic organisations from around the world.

It was created in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to provide funding to accelerate the development of vaccines for new diseases.

Dr Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at Cepi, said: ""The mission is to make sure that outbreaks are no longer a threat to humanity and to develop vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.""

'Molecular clamp'

Cepi is also funding two other programmes that are developing a vaccine for this new coronavirus.

The University of Queensland is working on a ""molecular clamp"" vaccine, which it says ""enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens.""

Image caption Fermenters grow bacteria to provide the main ingredient for a vaccine

Moderna Inc in Massachusetts has also joined forces with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to accelerate its research.

The WHO is co-ordinating this global quest for a new vaccine. It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi.

Although efforts to come up with a vaccine for this new coronavirus have been accelerated, research is still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Clinical trials take time and are best carried out within an outbreak setting.

There are no guarantees any of the designs so far will be safe and effective enough to be used in the outbreak in China.

Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo from the WHO's Health Emergencies programme said: ""We have developed a framework to inform decisions on which candidate vaccine(s) should be tested first.

""The experts will consider a number of criteria, including acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses.

""Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, its transmission, its clinical severity and developing effective counter measures is critical for the control of the outbreak.""

The WHO is due to decide which vaccine will be tested on humans first in the coming days.

Inovio has announced that it will collaborate with a biotech company in Beijing who can help manage human trials which are due to start in the summer.

Dr J. Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio, said: ""This collaboration allows us to enter China and deliver our vaccine into the areas where they need it most as soon as possible.""

Coronavirus Anger Boils Over in China and Doctors Plead for Supplies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/china-coronavirus-epidemic.html,01/30/20,www.nytimes.com,"WUHAN, China — One week into a lockdown, anger and anxiety deepened in China on Thursday as the central province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak endured shortages of hospital beds, medical supplies and doctors.

In a sign of growing frustration, a relative of a patient infected with the virus beat up a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, the state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday, citing the police. The man was accused of pulling and damaging the doctor’s mask and protective clothing — potentially exposing him to the virus — after his father-in-law died in the hospital. The man was later detained.

At the same time, hospitals in the region renewed pleas to the public for help to replenish their supplies, which were fast disappearing. The shortages have become especially severe in Huanggang, a city of seven million not far from Wuhan, where some medical staff members were wearing raincoats and garbage bags as shoe covers to protect against infection, according to Yicai, a financial news site.",
Asian markets close the week with losses amid coronavirus fears,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/30/investing/asian-market-latest/index.html,01/31/20,edition.cnn.com,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Hong Kong stocks plunged nearly 6% this week as the the spread of the coronavirus took its toll on markets.

Theclosed Friday 0.5% lower to finish down for a third straight session. It was closed the first two days of this week for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Elsewhere, South Korea'sdropped 1.4% on Friday, pushing its weekly loss to 5.7%. Japan'sended Friday 1% higher, but is also down for the week.

The coronavirus, which originated in central China, has now spread around the world. More than 200 people are dead and more than 9,600 people have been infected in mainland China. There have also been dozens of confirmed cases elsewhere, including India, the Philippines and the United States.

The World Health Organization has declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.

Separately, China's factory activity weakened ahead of the coronavirus outbreak, according to official data released Friday. The purchasing managers index for manufacturing reached 50 this month, lower than last month's 50.2 but in line with what analysts polled by Reuters expected.

Non-manufacturing PMI, a key indicator for the services sector, rose to 54.1, which was above December's 53.5.

A reading above 50 indicates growth from the previous month.

""The PMIs are usually valued as being among the first pieces of data released for an economy each month. But China's January PMI surveys have been overtaken by subsequent events,"" wrote Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China economist for Capital Economics, in a research note. ""The following months' PMIs will give insight into how damaging the virus is.""

He noted that the PMI surveys ended January 20, the same day Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated that the outbreak was serious.

Elsewhere, South Korean electronics maker LG reported sales of 62.3 trillion won ($52.5 billion) in 2019, a rise of 1% compared to 2018. Operating income fell about 1% to 2.4 trillion won ($2 billion).

Earnings were dragged down by the poor performance of LG's smartphone division. Sales of LG phones for 2019 plummeted 21% to 1.3 trillion won ($1.1 billion).

Shares in LG dropped 1.9% in Seoul on Friday.

SK Hynix, which supplies chips to smartphone maker Apple and others, saw profits collapse in the fourth quarter and miss analysts' estimates by a wide mark.

Operating profit plummeted 95% to 236 billion won ($199 million), the company's worst quarterly profit in seven years and far below what analysts expected, according to Refinitiv.

SK Hynix stock fell 0.5% in Seoul.

Coronavirus: Worldwide cases overtake 2003 Sars outbreak,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51322733,01/31/20,www.bbc.com,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus

The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003.

There were around 8,100 cases of Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - reported during the eight-month outbreak.

But nearly 10,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed, most in China, since it emerged in December.

More than 100 cases have been reported outside China, in 22 countries.

The number of deaths so far stands at 213 - all in China. In total, 774 people were killed by Sars.

On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency over the new outbreak.

The UK on Friday confirmed its first two cases of the virus.

In another development, the US also declared a public health emergency and said it would bar any foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks from entering the country.

Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the true total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. Based on mathematical models of the outbreak, experts there say more than 75,000 people may have been infected in the Chinese city of Wuhan alone, where the virus originated.

Most cases outside China are in people who have been to Wuhan. But Germany, Japan, Vietnam, the United States, Thailand and South Korea have reported person-to-person cases - patients being infected by people who had travelled to China.

Wuhan's Communist Party chief said on Friday the city should have taken measures sooner to contain the virus.

""If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,"" Ma Guoqiang told state broadcaster CCTV.

As governments around the world acted to contain the virus, WHO spokesman Chris Lindmeier warned that closing borders could in fact accelerate its spread, with travellers entering countries unofficially.

""As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases, whenever people want to travel, they will. And if the official paths are not opened, they will find unofficial paths,"" he said.

He said the best way to track the virus was at official border crossings.

How does this outbreak compare to Sars?

Sars was a type of coronavirus that first emerged in China's Guangdong province in November 2002. By the time the outbreak ended the following July, it had spread to more than two dozen countries.

The new coronavirus emerged only last month. So far, it has spread to fewer countries and - while more people have been infected globally - it has resulted in fewer deaths.

On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases within China surpassed the Sars epidemic.

Sars was also estimated to have cost the global economy more than $30bn (£22bn).

But economists have said the new coronavirus could have an even bigger impact on the world economy. It has forced global companies including tech giants, car makers and retailers to shut down temporarily in China.

China was also criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the original Sars outbreak.

It has been praised for responding to the latest virus with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities.

But in his interview with CCTV on Friday, the Wuhan Communist Party chief said transport restrictions should have been brought in at least 10 days earlier.

""The epidemic may have been alleviated somewhat, and not got to the current situation,"" Mr Ma said.

The estimates from the University of Hong Kong suggest the epidemic is doubling in size roughly every week and that multiple Chinese cities may have imported sufficient cases to start local epidemics.

""Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could potentially also become outbreak epicentres because of substantial spread of pre-symptomatic cases unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately,"" Professor Joseph Wu said.

Harder to spot and harder to stop

Why is this outbreak more difficult to stop than Sars?

The answer is not down to China - the speed and scale of the country's response to this new virus is widely considered to be unprecedented. The difference is the way the virus behaves inside the human body.

Sars was a brutal infection that you couldn't miss - patients were contagious only when they had symptoms. This made it relatively easy to isolate the sick and quarantine anyone who might have been exposed.

But the new virus, 2019-nCov, is harder to spot and therefore harder to stop.

From the virus's perspective, it has a far smarter evolutionary survival strategy than Sars.

The best estimate is only one-in-five cases cause severe symptoms, so instead of infected people turning up in hospital, you have to go out and find them.

And we are getting detailed documented cases of people spreading the virus before they even have symptoms.

There is a tendency to focus only on how deadly a virus is. But it is this, in combination with a virus's ability to spread, that determines its true threat.

How is China handling this?

A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has now reached every region in mainland China.

The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, which is at the heart of the outbreak.

The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home.

China has said it will send charter planes to bring back Hubei residents who are overseas ""as soon as possible"". A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the ""practical difficulties"" Chinese citizens had faced abroad.

The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country.

How is the world responding?

Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way.

The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.

Coronavirus death toll rises to 258 as US and others impose strict travel restrictions,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/30/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-update-intl-hnk/index.html,01/31/20,edition.cnn.com,"Hong Kong (CNN) The United States and other countries issued strict travel restrictions for foreign nationals who traveled to China as the number of deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak continued rising on Friday.

A day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency , Chinese authorities reported 45 deaths, all of them in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak of which Wuhan is the capital, bringing the total death toll across the country to 258.

As of Friday, there were more than 10,000 coronavirus cases confirmed in China, authorities said, an increase of over 2,000 from the previous day. That surpasses the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that began in southern China, which infected 8,098 people worldwide, killing 774.

More than 20 countries and territories outside of mainland China have confirmed cases of the virus -- spanning Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East -- as the United Kingdom reported its first two cases on Friday.

On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last two weeks and could pose a risk of spreading the virus, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.

Foreign nationals who are the immediate family of US citizens or permanent residents are exempt. US citizens returning to the United States who have been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks before their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine, Azar said.

The decision by the WHO prompted governments to upgrade their own response to the virus, with the US State Department raising its travel advisory for China to it's highest level: Do not travel.

The WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" that constitutes a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease,"" and ""to potentially require a coordinated international response."" Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1.

Ghebreyesus, who met this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, said the WHO ""continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak.""

""We would have seen many more cases outside China by now -- and probably deaths -- if it were not for the government's efforts,"" he added.

Much of China goes back to work on Monday, after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended in an attempt to rein in the virus. The fear now -- as tens of millions of people travel across the country and cities return to usual business -- is that new self-sustaining epidemic spots will rear up.

Many schools and universities across the country will remain closed for much of next week.

Evacuation and spread

As Wuhan and much of Hubei remains on lockdown in a bid to contain the virus, many countries have begun extracting their citizens from the city.

A charter plane carrying more than 350 South Koreans landed at Gimpo International Airport near Seoul on Friday, following flights organized by the US and Japan to evacuate their citizens. Multiple other governments, including the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are still arranging flights.

Meanwhile, more cases of the virus have been reported worldwide. Singapore confirmed three additional cases Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the city to 13.

Health officials said all 13 cases are in a stable condition and ""most are improving."" They also advised citizens to ""defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China.""

The Singapore government said it will distribute four masks each to 1.3 million households in the city from Saturday. Other Asian territories, particularly Hong Kong, have struggled to maintain supply of masks, with many stores running out following an initial rush by residents to stock up.

More than 130 infections with the virus -- but no deaths -- have been reported outside mainland China.

The UK has confirmed its first two cases of Wuhan coronavirus in the northwest of England, according to a statement by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England.

""We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS (National Health Service) care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,"" he said.

""The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread,"" he added.

""We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.""

Two of China's neighbors have instituted emergency measures to try and stop the virus spreading there. Russia said it was closing its border in the Far East, and limiting rail services from all of China from January 31. Meanwhile, North Korea declared a state of emergency and said it was instituting a ""hygienic and anti-epidemic"" response.

Work continues on Wuhan Huoshenshan hospital on January 30, 2020 in Wuhan, China. The 1,000-bed hospital is scheduled to open on February 5.

Facing a long quarantine

Much of Hubei has been under effective quarantine for weeks now, with almost every city facing travel restrictions in a province home to nearly 60 million people. Wuhan has been completely locked down, with residents cooped up in their homes and the streets abandoned.

Foreigners being airlifted out of the city are also facing up to two weeks of mandatory or voluntary quarantine once they land in their home countries.

However, this has sparked controversy in some countries, especially in Australia, where a plan to house evacuees in a former detention center for migrants on Christmas Island has generated no small amount of negative publicity .

Public broadcaster ABC spoke to some Australians in Wuhan who said they would rather remain in the city than face two weeks on what has been described by some opposition lawmakers as a ""leper camp,"" even as Canberra defended its decision as the only place capable of quarantining hundreds of people.

At March Air Reserve Base in Southern California, where US evacuees were flown earlier this week, one man said he was willing to remain under quarantine ""as long as I need.""

Jarred Evans said that the US Centers for Disease Control told evacuees that the initial 72-hour quarantine that was suggested ""is really not enough time, but you know, they're not obligated to keep us here.""

""You're not obligated to leave (when the 72 hours are up), so they're saying that the best thing for you, your people, your family and the community is to stay as long as possible,"" Evans said.

After flying out of near-freezing temperatures in Wuhan, Evans said he and the other passengers were spending time outdoors enjoying the sunny, 22 degrees Celsius (72F) weather.

""We're all still taking major precautions. So it's not like we're around here hugging each other and shaking hands and things like that,"" Evans said. ""We're wearing our masks ... But honestly, you know, everyone is enjoying themselves because what we experienced, what we've seen, is very serious, you know, people are dying. So when you see that and think about things like that, try to take as much appreciation of what is in front of you.""

What happens next?

Speaking on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry said the country had full ""confidence and capability"" in winning the fight against the virus.

""Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese government has been taking the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures with a high sense of responsibility for people's health,"" said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in a statement. ""Many of these measures go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations. We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic.""

China has taken major measures to try and contain the epidemic, locking much of Hubei down, partially closing the border with Hong Kong and extending the Lunar New Year holiday, all of which could have a severe drain on the country's economy, already vulnerable due to the US-China trade war.

With most people due to go back to work on Monday, it remains unclear whether more measures will be announced, and if not, how this will influence the spread of the virus.

Health experts previously estimated that the number of cases could be far higher than currently confirmed. Researchers at Imperial College London have estimated that at least 4,000 people were infected in Wuhan by January 18, almost a week before the lockdown began. Their model suggests a low national figure of 20,000 infections by the end of the month, potentially as high as 100,000.

Researchers in Hong Kong estimate there could be 75,815 people in Wuhan infected with coronavirus as of January 25, according to a paper published Friday in The Lancet.

Trump puts Cuban doctors in firing line as heat turned up on island economy,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/11/trump-puts-cuban-doctors-in-firing-line-as-heat-turned-up-on-island-economy,02/11/20,www.theguardian.com,"A Cuban medical programme that has helped some of the worlds poorest communities has become the latest target of the Trump administrations escalating attempts to pressure Havanas faltering economy. Dubbed ""Cuban doctors"", the celebrated - if controversial - humanitarian medical mission was founded more than half a century ago in the aftermath of Fidel Castros revolution, in part to enhance the countrys international influence. Currently active in over 60 countries, the scheme has provided healthcare across the globe, from indigenous Amazon peoples to slum residents in Africa to the victims of Haitis 2010 earthquake. Now its work has come under renewed fire via a combination of allegations, led by Washington, which has accused Havana of using the doctors to undermine democracy, not least in Venezuela - which hosts one of the biggest missions. Havana has also been accused - in claims taken up by Washington - of ""exploiting"" the medical staff sent on the missions. One report suggested work conditions, low salaries and coercion amounted to ""modern slavery"". In response, Cuban officials, and analysts who have closely studied the work of the medical missions, accuse the US of using the claims as cover for its policy of strangling the Cuban economy in the hope of damaging the left-wing regime, while warning that poor patients will be the biggest victims. According to Cubas ministry of foreign affairs, more than 600,000 Cuban medical staff, including doctors, nurses and technicians, have been sent to more than 160 countries since the 1960s. Cuba offered to send physicians to the US to aid relief efforts for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Photograph: Jorge Rey/AP While some two dozen missions are provided free of cost by Havana, other countries where the doctors are deployed pay Cuba for the medical services, bringing in $6.3bn (PS4.8bn) annually, Havanas largest source of foreign currency. The US campaign against the Cuban doctors has intensified amid recent political changes in Latin America, which have led to the expulsion of the missions from several countries, including Bolivia and Brazil, where left-wing governments have been replaced by right-wing regimes closely aligned with Trump and Washington. Relations between Cuba and the US have deteriorated since the election of Donald Trump, who reinforced sanctions against the island. Photograph: Yamil Lage/Getty At the forefront of the allegations is US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has both depicted the deployment of Cuban doctors in countries from Venezuela to Brazil and Ecuador as sinister interference in their affairs, and congratulated countries - like Bolivia - that have expelled them. Pompeo has been backed by other senior US officials and agencies, including deputy secretary of state Michael Kozak, who has also latched on to recent claims about the doctors working conditions. ""The Castro regime sends up to 50,000 Cuban medical staff overseas to work in harsh conditions. Stories of abuses abound. The regime pockets 75% of the doctors salaries, and using (sic) them to keep allied regimes in power,"" Kozak tweeted before Christmas. The main US development agency, USAid, has also weighed in, offering to fund organisations helping to expose negative aspects of the scheme. They have accused Cuba of ""exploit[ing] its medical professionals ... using them to buy international financial and political support and keep its struggling economy afloat, while pocketing the majority of these workers salaries and subjecting them to poor living conditions, constant surveillance, and threatening those who wish to leave their mission"". The claims surrounding the doctors work conditions were fuelled by a report last year by NGO Prisoners Defenders, which claimed to have interviewed more than 100 doctors, allegations taken up by two UN rapporteurs. Critics say Washingtons campaign against the doctors, which includes attempts to persuade them to defect, is little more than an attempt to strangle the amount of foreign revenue that they bring in - much of which is ploughed back into Cubas health and social services. In December Johana Tablada, deputy director of North America at the Cuban ministry of foreign affairs, said Trump administration officials had been pressuring Latin American governments to end the medical support programs, hurting healthcare in those countries. ""The government of President Trump has crossed the red line of decency by taking the foreign relations of the United States to levels of hypocrisy and double standards that none of his predecessors have done,'' Tablada said. While the Cuban doctors have been criticised in the past, not least by those who say they undercut poor countries development of their own healthcare systems and medical training, the current US pressure on the programme coincides with the election of Donald Trump and his apparent determination to reverse the warming of relations between the US and Cuba that took place under the Obama administration. Cuban doctor Ralfis Carbort shortly before leaving to help with the devastation caused by Hurricane Idai. Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP ""The [US policy] is targeting the two main sources of external income for Cuba, first tourism and now medical services,"" explained Pavel Vidal Alejandro, a Cuban-born academic at the Xavierian University in Colombia. ""Medical services represent around 60% of Cubas total foreign income,"" he told the Guardian. ""Its the old policy of applying a high pressure cooker strategy in the hope it will produce social protests. That didnt happen in the past and is not happening now."" John Kirk, an academic at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has interviewed several hundred Cuban doctors is also sceptical about some of the claims - which he believes are ""exaggerated"" - and about the real reasons for the targeting of the Cuban doctors. ""Over the last 12 years Ive interviewed 270 doctors, nurses and technicians and stayed with them on missions,"" he said. And, Kirk said, while it is clear that some doctors on the missions do defect or complain about working conditions, salaries and political pressure, his impression has been that many are motivated to join the missions and are happy at the opportunity to earn far more than they would practising medicine in Cuba. ""Its in the DNA, the idea of a vocation,"" he added. ""One thing the doctors always said to me is how they can earn more than in Cuba. Another motivation mentioned was the experience they gained in some of these places, which they described as a living medical text book. They go to places others wont go."" Kirk mentioned the Mais Medicos (More Doctors) programme originally set up in Brazil by former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and ended when the right-wing demagogue and Trump supporter Jair Bolsonaro came to power last year. ""If you look at the situation in Brazil, Mais Medicos brought healthcare to to indigenous populations, to places like the Amazon that had never never seen doctors before. ""And whats also missed [in the criticism] is that the programme brings in money to subsidise the Cuban healthcare."" Guardian interviews with Cuban doctors who have served on medical missions, including those shut down in Bolivia and Brazil, portrayed a far more nuanced story than that depicted by the US and some of the critics. While many would prefer to keep more of their salaries and enjoy better working conditions, they denied they felt like ""slaves"". Instead, for Dr Yoandra Muro, until recently the head of the expelled mission in Bolivia, the threats came instead from the new right-wing government that ousted left-wing president Evo Morales. She said they were accused of ""being a white-coated army"". ""[Towards the end of the mission] the police entered our houses and took belongings of our colleagues. These were the same people wed been giving healthcare to. It was very difficult to understand how overnight you turn from a doctor into a terrorist. ""We were in 35 hospitals where the majority of our professionals were specialists. This means there are 35 hospitals- where children are being born, where urgent surgery is required - that today dont have those professionals. ""You can imagine the insecurity that they feel. There were lots of patients who cried when we left, that felt the pain of their doctor going, that said 'what am I going to do now? Who will treat me now?"" She added: ""What a contradiction! Either were victims or we are threats."" Yanet Rosales, 32, is a family doctor in Cuba who has completed two foreign medical missions including with Mais Medicos . Like many, she said the ability to earn far more than a doctor in Cuba was a strong motivating factor. ""From a personal point of view, Id always wanted to go to Brazil and this was my opportunity. Theres also the economic factor. They pay us much more to be there, so this was a factor. ""The Brazilian government paid around EUR6,000 (PS5,091) a month for our services [as doctors] of which we got to take home EUR1,500. The Cuban government took the rest to buy medical equipment and to improve health here. ""I never felt exploited.On the contrary ... but were not totally in agreement with it. We were the ones working and far away from the family. Of course, weve got to help the country, we are there thanks to our government. We are aware that we are doctors thanks to the state, but we didnt agree with the percentage we were getting. We think it should have been 50-50. ""But at the same time, if we werent fully in agreement with the contract, we wouldnt have gone. They put those conditions to us before we went, so we cant complain either."" For Kirk, the outlook is worrying. ""If Trump gets re-elected all bets are off. The US policy is a continuing process. Death by a thousand cuts.""",
Cubans Protest Communist Party's Plan to Ignore Pandemic for Cash,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/03/20/cubans-protest-communist-partys-plan-ignore-pandemic-cash/,03/20/20,www.breitbart.com,"Cuban anti-communist dissidents took to the internet Thursday to demand the Castro regime stop inviting global tourism to the country while the rest of the world deals with a pandemic of the highly contagious Chinese coronavirus, noting Cubas destitute healthcare system and shortages of basic hygienic goods. At press time, the Castro regime has reported 16 cases of coronavirus on the island, nearly all tourists carrying the virus when the arrived, and one death among them. Havana has issued statements refusing to close the nations schools and inviting global tourists to choose Cuba as a vacation destination, a marked departure from nearly all the worlds governments, which have closed their borders and urged their citizens not to travel. The Cuban military controls the islands entire tourism industry, investing the billions in annual revenue in maintaining the communist police state and repressing pro-democracy dissidents at home and in its colony, Venezuela. The Ministry of Tourism has not urged tourists to change plans or organized screening of visitors. To the extent that the Cuban Communist Party is acting to limit the spread of the Chinese coronavirus on the island, it is asking local parents to provide schools with basics like soap and water, which many Cubans cannot afford and have no access to. Cubas communist ration system greatly limits what products citizens can buy and why, and also ensures a catastrophic, unproductive economy that cannot keep stores stocked even if citizens could buy these items. The call to bring soap and water to schools, rather than the communist government fulfilling its promises to provide for the people, have made many mothers livid. ""There is no soap in my house to guarantee the necessary hygienic-sanitary measures, now tell me how am I going to find soap to send to the school?"" Jessica Miranda, a mother affected by the policy, told the independent outlet Cubanet. ""They asked us parents to bring everything: masks, chlorine, soap, even water. Five masks because they have to be changed every two hours, and I cant even find one."" Prevented from organizing mass protests by commonly held medical advice for people to avoid crowds to prevent the rapid spread of coronavirus, Cuban anti-communist dissidents have taken to posting photos and videos on social media demanding the Castro regime take proper measures to protect its citizenry. In a digital protest from their homes Thursday, dissidents demanded the closure of points of entry and better investment in the near-collapsed Cuban healthcare system. ""The Castro dictatorship lies. In a time when the coronavirus pandemic is extended throughout the world, the communist regime tries to sell a false image of what is happening in Cuba to the international community,"" Arianna Lopez, wife of political prisoner Mitzael Diaz Paseiro, said in a video shared online by the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a pro-democracy advocacy group. ""World, there is nothing in Cuba. In Cuba, there are no resources, no food, no medicine. Cuban mothers have no way of facing a quarantine."" ""Its up to Cubans, ourselves, to take the measures ... this regime does not want to close the airports, it keeps receiving tourists, it keeps attempting - with who knows what macabre intentions - to make us sick,"" Lopez continued. ""It isnt known what is going to happen. The future of the Cuban is uncertain."" Lopez noted that Cuba has not only put into place no measures whatsoever to prevent the spread of the virus, ordinary life in Cuba places the average citizen at high risk, due to the need to stand for hours on ration lines for basics such as bread, chicken, and eggs. ""The interminable lines continue and this is one of the principal sources of contagion, the crowding of people, but if Cubans do not get on a line, they die - if not [killed] by coronavirus, by hunger,"" Lopez explained. In another video message, a group of dissidents of the Coronel Vicente Mendez group accuses the Castro regime of ""an attack on the Cuban people"" and ""crimes against humanity"" for failing to protect the Cuban people from the pandemic. ""While all the governments, left-wing and right-wing, throughout the world have shut their borders and put their peoples in quarantine, the Castro communist regime keeps its borders open and exhorting tourists from around the world to come into Cuba,"" a spokesman denounced, ""knowing the endemic problem that the healthcare system here has."" Others nationwide protested by simply photographing themselves holding signs up reading ""enough,"" a call for an end to the current policies. Some dissidents also stuck handwritten protest signs in public areas. In one such instance, under government graffiti celebrating 60 years of communism, dissidents posted a sign reading, ""In Cuba, there are no resources to fight the coronavirus."" In addition to keeping schools open and inviting tourists, the Castro regime is not checking incoming visitors fevers or doing any screening. It has suggested to visitors that they isolate themselves if arriving from affected countries - at this point over 100 countries worldwide - and has adamantly defended its choice of keeping the borders open. ""The Cuban state has not made the decision yet to close borders with any country, but it has established closed monitoring of all passengers, especially those coming from countries of [high] risk,"" Francisco Duran, the national director of hygiene and epidemiology at Cubas Health Ministry, said on Thursday. ""Quarantines are established depending on transmission and, at this moment, cannot be justified.""",
Joe Biden Tells Miami TV Station He Would Bring Back Obama's Cuba Policy,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/28/joe-biden-tells-miami-tv-station-he-would-bring-back-obamas-cuba-policy/,04/28/20,www.breitbart.com,"Former Vice President Joe Biden told Miami-area CBS 4 on Monday evening that he would restore President Barack Obamas policy of ""engagement with the communist regime in Cuba. Last month, Biden slammed then-rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for praising the Cuban regime -- an attack amplified by the media in the days that followed Sanderss stunning victory in Nevada, which put the ""democratic socialist"" in a position to win the Democratic Partys presidential nomination. Now, however, Biden has backtracked -- and is fully on board with the policy of ""normalization"" he supported under Obama. From CBS 4: Regarding Cuba, Biden said he would restore the Obama policy of engagement. ""Yes, I would. In large part, I would go back,"" Biden said. ""Id still insist they keep the commitments they said they would make when we, in fact, set the policy in place."" Wouldnt he be rewarding Cuba at a time when they are supporting and propping up Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela? ""Well, theyre having great difficulty propping up Maduro,"" he said. ""Number one, Maduro is in real trouble. Number two, theres no reason why we cannot still sanction them, but failing to recognize them at all is a different thing than sanctioning them."" He said engaging with Cuba isnt just about Cuba, it also strengthens the United States hand throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Obamas policy ""normalized"" relations with the Castro regime and saw embassies re-opened in Havana and Washington, DC. However, it did not lead to any change in the regimes behavior toward political dissidents or its intervention in the region. Cuban dissidents regard the Obama administrations policy as a ""disaster"" that actually increased the regimes repression. The Trump administration has not closed the embassies, but has ended many of the travel and ""exchange"" programs with Cuba, and has slapped new sanctions on Cuba for its human rights abuses and its support of the Venezuelan regime. Florida, a key swing state in presidential elections, is home to many immigrants from Cuba and from Venezuela, and the Obama administrations policies toward both regimes have been unpopular among local voters.

Cuba shuts down interprovincial transportation due to new COVID-19 fears,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cuba-idUSKBN2630RZ,09/12/20,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban state media reported on Saturday interprovincial transportation would be shut down and a curfew in Havana extended until the end of the month as a surge in COVID-19 cases in the capital spreads to other areas. Slideshow ( 2 images ) While most of the country remains at a new normal with schools and retail activity open, local authorities have been tightening enforcement of wearing masks, social distancing and other measures for fear of spread and imposing quarantines wherever cases appear. Cuba had mostly contained its novel coronavirus outbreak by the end of June, by isolating patients and contacts, and eased lockdown restrictions. But it tightened them again in Havana by August and has yet to contain a spike in cases there with around 200 reported over the last week. There have been smaller outbreaks in a handful of Cubas 14 provinces. Now central Ciego de Avila province has suffered the worst outbreak to date after Havana with cases reaching 28 of 60 reported in the country Saturday. All but a few of the remainder were in Havana. One hundred patients were moved to a hospital in neighboring Camaguey province from Ciego de Avila on Thursday due to a shortage of hospital space. In August, a brigade of nurses marched off from eastern Granma province to the capital as if they were some of the 4,000 medical staff sent abroad to battle the pandemic. While just under 4,700 cases have been reported since the first one in March and only 108 deaths, the U.S. embargoed Caribbean nation has been all but bankrupted by the pandemics toll on tourism, remittances, investment and trade. Economic growth is now forecast to drop by close to 10 percent this year according to various international organizations and there are long lines for basic goods and shortages of certain foods and medicines.",
"Trump implements new travel restrictions to Cuba, bans purchase of rum and tobacco",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-announces-ban-on-purchasing-rum-tobacco-from-cuba,09/23/20,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! President Trump announced new restrictions for American travelers going to Cuba, barring them from purchasing rum and tobacco or staying in Cuban government-funded hotels. The Treasury Department announced regulatory changes under the new rules that restrict importing Cuba-origin alcohol and tobacco products and prevent travelers from attending or organizing certain professional meetings or conferences in Cuba, as well as public performances, clinics, workshops, competitions, and other exhibitions in the country. Trump also applied new sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as part of an ongoing crackdown against communism. The announcement was made during the president's address honoring Bay of Pigs veterans who survived a failed attempt nearly 60 years ago to topple the communist government of the late Fidel Castro in Cuba. TRUMP ISSUES ORDER BANNING CERTAIN TYPES OF RACE TRAINING FROM FEDERAL CONTRACTORS, GRANT RECIPIENTS The Bay of Pigs Veterans Association endorsed Trump's presidency in 2016 and Trump thanked the group for officially endorsing him again for his bid of a second term in office. ""The Obama-Biden administration made a weak, pathetic, one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. I canceled the Obama-Biden sellout to the Castro regime,"" Trump said during Wednesday's remarks from the White House's East Room. In 2017, Trump abandoned attempts at diplomacy with Cuba brokered under former President Barack Obama and reimposed economic sanctions on the island nation, as well as travel restrictions that had been relaxed under the previous administration. Trump's newest sanctions threaten to further cripple Cuba's tourism industry already caving in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic. Cuba's government owns all of the hotels on the island. ""The Cuban governments profits from properties in the hospitality industry owned or controlled by the Cuban government, senior regime officials, Cuban Communist Party leadership, and their families, disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, all at the expense of the Cuban people, who continue to face repression at the hands of the regime,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. Democratic presidential rival Vice President Joe Biden has said he would consider reversing course if he becomes president and reattempting diplomatic advancements with current Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel. ""This is a desperate and hypocritical attempt by Trump to pander to Cuban-American voters in Florida. American citizens are already banned from traveling to Cuba because of the coronavirus, and Trump has privately sought to do business with the country for years and ignored the embargo,"" DNC spokesperson Enrique Gutierrez said in a statement to Fox News. ""Hes filed trademarks with the Cuban government to make money on golf courses, hotels, and more -- but now that hes lagging in the polls, hes just using our foreign policy for his own political gain,"" Gutierrez said. During his brief remarks that also touched on honoring Hispanic Heritage Month, Trump alluded to parallels between ongoing Black Lives Matter and social justice protests in the U.S. and communist tyranny in Cuba.

"Trump imposes new bans on Cuban rum, cigars, hotels",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba-idUSKCN26E2OL,09/23/20,www.reuters.com,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday banned U.S. citizens from bringing home rum or cigars from Cuba and from staying at Cuban government-owned hotels, as he sought to lock in the Cuban-American vote in the swing state of Florida ahead of Novembers presidential election. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Since Trump took office in January 2017, he has been rolling back a detente with Americas old Cold War foe pursued by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trumps aides believe his toughened stance has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in a state where he and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are locked in a tight race. ""Today, as part of our continuing fight against communist oppression, I am announcing that the Treasury Department will prohibit U.S. travelers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government,"" Trump said at a White House event. ""Were also further restricting the importation of alcohol and Cuban tobacco,"" the Republican president said at the ceremony honoring Bay of Pigs veterans. Trumps decision overturns Obamas policy of allowing American travelers to bring back as much of Cubas legendary rum and cigars that they could carry in their baggage for personal use. A Treasury factsheet said U.S. citizens would be allowed to buy rum and cigars while visiting the Communist-run island, but would no longer be permitted to bring those products home. ""The current U.S. authorities insist on the application of a sanctions policy against Cuba that has not achieved the proposed objectives in 60 years,"" said a Cuban embassy official in Washington. ""It is a wrong policy that is widely rejected by American society and even among Cuban Americans."" The measures - which bar Americans from staying at more than 430 hotels owned or controlled by the government and impose new restrictions on professional meetings, performances and sports competitions - are intended to deny revenue to Cuban authorities. They are not expected to have any immediate impact since the island is closed off to foreign travelers due to the coronavirus pandemic. Carrie Filipetti, deputy assistant secretary of state for Cuba and Venezuela, said the new policy ""will continue even past the pandemic."" Trump and Biden are competing fiercely in Florida, which Trump won in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points. Trump will hold a rally in Jacksonville on Thursday. Filipetti denied the measures were timed for electoral gain, saying they had been in the works for some time. In June 2019, the Trump administration imposed heavy new restrictions on travel to Cuba, saying the move aimed to further pressure the Communist government over its support for Venezuelas embattled President Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this year, the Trump administration ordered Marriott International MAR.O to wind down hotel operations in Communist-run Cuba. Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, was the first U.S. hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid normalization of relations sought by Obama.",

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced new sanctions on Cuba restricting imports of Cuban rum and cigars and banning Americans from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government.

The Treasury Department said at the time that the US would no longer allow so-called ""group people-to-people educational travel"", one of the most popular exemptions to the overall ban on US tourism to Cuba. Earlier this year, the Trump administration also ordered Marriott International to wind down its hotel operations in Cuba. Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, was the first US hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution after Obama sought to normalise relations with the regime.

""This Administration is committed to denying Cubas oppressive regime access to revenues used to fund their malign activities, both at home and abroad."" The Trump administrations sanctions have further crippled Cubas economy already struggling from the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in aid from struggling leftist ally Venezuela. Back in July, communist-run Cuba announced that it was loosening restrictions on small businesses to help stimulate the battered domestic economy. The Cuban American expatriate community in south Florida is a crucial constituency for Republicans in US presidential elections.

Cuba Claims to Be Testing Two Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/10/28/cuba-claims-be-testing-two-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates/,10/28/20,www.breitbart.com,"The Communist Party of Cuba announced on Tuesday that it had registered the second of two vaccine candidates against the Chinese coronavirus, which would begin its first round of trials ""soon"" -- Havana promised results on the vaccine studies by January 2021. Cuba is home to one of the worlds most deteriorated healthcare systems after decades of communist rule and heavy investment in its slave doctor system, which rakes in for the regime an estimated $11 billion a year. Cuban officials admitted last year to an increasingly alarming shortage on the island of basic drugs, long before the Chinese coronavirus pandemic swept the world. The two vaccines, dubbed Soberana [""sovereign""] 01 and Soberana 02, are the latest attempt by the Castro regime to inject itself into the global race to end the pandemic. Cubas second-in-command, Miguel Diaz-Canel, claimed at the debut of the first vaccine candidate that its name ""evokes the feelings of patriotism and revolutionary and humanistic commitment with which it has been worked on, and also the commitment to the foundational, and when we talk about foundational, we are talking about the Commander-in-Chief [Fidel Castro]."" Cuban government agents, along with allies in socialist dictatorships like Venezuela, have also promoted the use of interferons -- anti-viral proteins -- to treat the virus, despite no evidence in the free world that the treatment works and warnings from legitimate doctors that improper use of interferons could kill patients. The Russian news agency TASS revealed on Tuesday that Cuba had announced the launch of Soberana 02. Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, teased the vaccine candidate last week, claiming it was ""unprecedented among all of those being developed to face [Chinese coronavirus] around the world."" Vicente Verez Bencomo, the director-general of the Finlay Vaccine Institute in Cuba, told the state propaganda outlet that Soberana 02 would work as a ""conjugate vaccine,"" a type of immunization mechanism most commonly used against bacterial infectious disease. ""The conjugate vaccines currently know[n] have two distinctive properties: they induce long-term immunity and the antibodies generated not only protect against disease, but they block bacteria from colonizing the oropharynx of the vaccinated,"" Verez said. The doctor added that he expects ""similar"" results against the Chinese coronavirus despite the fact that it is not a bacterium. Verez added at the time that initial trials on Soberana 01 were a success and that patients receiving the vaccine candidate had ""very few side effects, all of them light,"" calling into question the need for Soberana 02. The initial vaccine remains in Phase One clinical study. In August, Verez claimed that he personally received Soberana 01 as part of its study, as well as two other members of the Finlay institute. The Castro regime occasionally declares itself the source of a miracle vaccine; last year, it claimed to have produced a vaccine against lung cancer. Yet, it imports many doses of basic vaccines necessary to maintain a functional healthcare system, sometimes raising health concerns at home. Last year, Cuban doctors killed a one-year-old girl, Paloma Dominguez Caballero, by giving her a standard Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine at her 12-month well visit. Shortly after her death, reports revealed that Cuba was importing its MMR vaccines from an Indian company linked to the deaths of three children via faulty vaccines in Cuba in 2002. The Castro regime did not, apparently, change sourcing for vaccines after the deaths. At the time of Dominguezs death, reports from Cuba suggested that several other children -- the number varied in reports from four to eight -- also experienced extreme adverse effects from the MMR vaccine offered at the same clinic where staffers killed Dominguez. After Dominguezs mother began using social media to attract attention to her case with success, the Communist Party attempted to intimidate her into silence, resulting in both of the childs parents fleeing the country just a month later. Cuban authorities did not update on the status of the other children, nor did any other parents surface with complaints. Regarding the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in particular, doctors have warned that the Communist Partys claims that interferons cure coronavirus may seriously hurt patients. ""When the Government of Cuba assures that the Interferon developed in Cuba cures the coronavirus, it is committing a serious crime against world public health, since this drug not only lacks any scientific proof, but also where it has been tested has already given null results of encouragement,"" a group of doctors said in a letter published by the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders in April. ""Cuba should receive a formal warning from the authorities of the World Health Organization for publicizing a media hoax about which there is no evidence, but quite the contrary, and whose consequences may be harmful to the lives of thousands of patients worldwide,"" the doctors concluded. Cubas alleged vaccine candidate is competing with 43 other vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials and dozens of others identified as being in a ""pre-clinical"" stage, according to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) master list. China dominates the list of vaccine candidates, though the list includes a variety of other nations such as the United States, Japan, Germany, and Kazakhstan.

Cuban State Media: Florida Cubans 'Applaud Genocide',https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/04/cuban-state-media-florida-cubans-applaud-genocide/,11/04/20,www.breitbart.com,"The official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma, published a column Wednesday accusing Cuban-Americans of supporting the ""genocide"" of their family on the island and expressing disgust at Florida voters for their embrace of ""democracy"" and ""individual freedom."" The article went on to conclude, similar to propaganda in government websites run by fellow rogue states China and Iran, that President Donald Trump and his rival Joe Biden were not ideologically distinct, as they both support the continued existence of the United States. Granma also featured a column from October on its front page Thursday that dismissed the American electoral system as a ""circus"" marred by ""lies, lowliness, deceit, [and] cheating."" Cuba is a communist one-party state with no legitimate enfranchisement of its people. The Castro regime maintains a rubber-stamp legislature for which citizens can vote, but the Party has final approval of any name on the ballot and few, if any, races are contested. The Castro regime claims itself to be more democratic than America because it maintains a strict socialist system that keeps the island impoverished and deprives citizens of individual freedom through state violence. ""Its obvious that each contestant, above all, aspires to win votes, given that Florida is a vital state for that purpose,"" author Antonio Rodriguez Salvador wrote. ""But in this way, one observes the unfortunate reality of compatriots who, with enthusiasm, applaud a dreamed-of genocide of those who were their neighbors, their old schoolmates, or relatives still left in Cuba."" Rodriguez appeared to be referring to sanctions on Cuba, a policy known as the ""embargo,"" that has been in place since late dictator Fidel Castro took over the island in 1959. In theory, the embargo bans Americans from doing business with Cuba, including tourism. In reality, corporations and extremely wealthy individual Americans have flaunted the embargo for decades through various loopholes, including exceptions for activities such as ""aid to the Cuban people."" Under President Barack Obama, the United States allowed tourism on cruise ships and with tour groups through a category of exception called ""people to people"" travel, which President Trump revoked. In contrast to the loose nature of the American embargo on Cuba, the Castro regime imposes a strict embargo on the United States, preventing Cuban nationals from traveling there without explicit Communist Party permission and preventing Cuban-Americans from freely sending basic food and goods not commonly available in Cuba due to its failed socialist economic system. Rodriguez went on to claim that Cuban-American voters support ""lynching all communists"" and supported limiting remittances to Cuba, which largely go through Cuban regime-controlled systems and thus profit the communists. ""One recalls the media carpet-bombing that the German people received in the 30s and 40s of the last century, that ended in the Holocaust of the Jewish people. There are things that appear grotesque if not for, suddenly, noticing behind them the hand directing a chorus of hate from which people with academic backgrounds and even authors do not escape,"" Rodriguez concluded. Granma's ire towards Cuban-Americans appears to be a response to the overwhelming support that President Trump received from that community in Florida on Tuesday, cementing his victory in a critical swing state. Trump clinched significant percentages of the Hispanic vote generally around the country in states where he had fared less well in 2016, but gains in south Florida, and particularly Miami-Dade County, vastly improved his results in the state. Trump campaigned heavily on opposing socialism and Bidens ties to prominent socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The communist writers article was largely dedicated to making the case that Trump and Biden are not distinct presidential candidates, arguing, ""the candidate of the oligarchy always wins."" "" ""They call 'democracy over there the race between two gentlemen who represent the same economic and ideological interests, selected by an elite that bets with a lot of money on both sides, and that takes for a debate a type of show where lies and personal insults abound,"" the column claimed. Elsewhere in Cuban media, Granma declared the election a ""circus."" ""Presidential candidates in the U.S. have to have the resistance to withstand a competition where all is fair: low blows, personal attacks, race, gender, lies, lowliness, deceit, cheating,"" Granma told its readers, a largely captive audience given the nature of the Communist Party. This article also made the claim that the two-party system was not diverse: ""It doesnt matter if they are blue or red, Democrats or Republicans, they represent one party, that of the very rich."" The 2020 presidential election remains contested at press time. Swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada remain in play. President Trump has verbally challenged results in several states, including taking legal action in Michigan. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
Biden's team is planning a Cuba reset: Sources,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/12/15/bb-bidens-team-is-planning-a-cuba-reset-sources,12/15/20,www.aljazeera.com,"President-elect Joe Bidens team is planning to reverse many of the sanctions and regulations imposed on Cuba under the Trump administration, sources tell Bloomberg News. President-elect Joe Bidens team plans to bring the U.S. closer to normalized relations with Cuba, reversing many of the sanctions and regulations imposed during the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the matter. That strategy includes reducing restrictions on travel, investment and remittances for the island nation that are perceived to disproportionately hurt Americans and ordinary Cubans, said the people, who requested anonymity because the new administration is still coming together. Other measures that target Cuba for human rights abuses would remain in place, the people said. The prospect of a detente between Washington and Havana rekindles memories of the thaw that Biden helped champion during the Obama administration, when the two nations restored diplomatic ties that had been broken for decades following Fidel Castros rise to power. But the president-elect is returning to an even messier scene: the Cuban economy is suffering its worst crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union amid fallout from Covid-19 and U.S. sanctions. At the same time, Cuban intelligence officers have helped prop up Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, allowing his regime to consolidate its grip on power in defiance of demands for free and fair elections. With a packed domestic agenda, its unclear how quickly Biden will move on implementing his Cuba policy. Even if some changes happen early, the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown could delay the benefits of any measures that allow for greater travel to the island. Its also unclear whether Biden will increase staffing at the U.S. embassy in Havana. The Trump administration pared back diplomatic operations after strange illnesses, including brain trauma, afflicted some U.S. diplomats and their families. Biden said in October that the U.S. needed a new Cuba policy, though his team has been firm in condemning efforts by Havana to silence dissidents, including a recent raid on a house full of activists and artists. The president-elect has also denounced Venezuelas Maduro as a dictator. Just as the Trump administration connected Cuba and Venezuela policy, using sanctions as a tool intended to spur political change, Bidens team may try to leverage a rapprochement in exchange for the Cubans reducing their presence in Venezuela and supporting a diplomatic resolution to the crisis there, according to the people. We support the Cuban people in their struggle for liberty and echo calls for the Cuban government to release peaceful protestors. The Cuban people must be allowed to exercise the universal right to freedom of expression. -- Jake Sullivan (@jakejsullivan) November 29, 2020 Another complicating factor is Florida. While Bidens advisers have criticized Trumps Latin American policies for being heavily influenced by electoral politics, particularly the goal of winning the Sunshine State, they still face a sobering reality: The Democratic Party must defend a narrow House majority in 2022. Any policies that are perceived as easing pressure on Cuba and Venezuela without getting significant concessions from their left-wing governments could risk backlash at the polls. For their part, investors are showing an early vote of confidence in Bidens potential Cuba policy. The $43 million Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, which is geared toward Cuba and the Caribbean, has surged 40% since the U.S. election.",
"UPDATE 1-Cuba says economy shrank 11% in 2020, thwarts 'soft coup' attempts",https://www.reuters.com/article/cuba-economy-idUSL1N2IY01N,12/18/20,www.reuters.com,"(Recasts with presidents speech) HAVANA, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Cubas already cash-strapped economy shrank 11% in 2020 due to the pandemic and tougher U.S. sanctions but the government thwarted attempts by anti-communists to exploit this momentary weakness in a bid to topple it, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Thursday. Addressing a year-end session of the Communist-run countrys parliament, Diaz-Canel celebrated Cubas successful management of its coronavirus outbreak despite ""exceptional economic conditions"" and predicted 6% to 7% economic growth next year. Yet the governments estimate for this years contraction was even more dire than that of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which this week predicted an 8.5% contraction for Cuba compared to a 7.7% regional decline. Cuba received just 55% of the hard currency it had planned this year, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil told the assembly earlier in the day. Gil did not provide data on the debt, trade or current account but earlier this week had told a parliament commission that imports were down 30% compared to last year. Cuba imports more than 50% of its fuel, food and many other vital inputs and this decline, coming on top of a 15% drop in 2019, has resulted in a scarcity and long lines for even the most basic products, from food and medicine to fuel. Diaz-Canel said the government had thwarted attempts by anti-communists to capitalize on this moment of economic weakness to ""destroy"" the Cuban leftist revolution. Over the past three weeks, state-run media have run shows on what they say are attempts directed and financed from the United States to create unrest on the island, like attacks on state shops and a hunger strike by an artists collective. ""New provocations are on the way and we will vanquish those too,"" the president said. Critics say the government is trying to undermine legitimate discontent among some Cubans and requests for greater civil liberties underscored by a rare rights protest by artists outside the culture ministry late last month. Diaz-Canel warned on Thursday of ""wolves in sheeps clothing"" and said attempts at non conventional warfare and a soft coup by the ""industry of counterrevolution"" would fail. Nothing, he said, should distract the country from its ""most complex task"" of recent decades, pointing to the monetary reform taking place from January including a steep devaluation in bid to revitalise the economy. Earlier in the day, Gil said a gradual recovery would begin in 2021, based mainly on that reform and a 50% increase in tourist arrivals to 2.2 million in 2021, compared with more than 4 million in 2019. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has also promised to unravel some of President Donald Trumps sanctions on Cuba aimed at forcing political reform such as restrictions on travel and remittances. Diaz-Canel said the Trump administrations attempts had ""roundly and notoriously failed"". However, the government remained open to improving relations with the United States, he said, without explicitly referring to the incoming Biden administration.

U.S. Re-Designates Cuba a State Sponsor of Terrorism,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/01/11/u-s-re-designates-cuba-ally-hezbollah-marxist-farc-state-sponsor-terrorism/,01/11/21,www.breitbart.com,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that his department would return Cuba to its list of State Sponsors of Terrorism over the Castro regimes ties to international terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Castro regime -- which regularly imprisons Cuban citizens for crimes such as ""disrespect"" if caught speaking ill about the government in public -- also openly harbors violent American criminals, most prominently Joanne Chesimard, who killed a New Jersey State Trooper in 1973. After decades on the list -- since 1982 -- President Barack Obama removed Cuba from the official State Department list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in 2015, claiming the evidence did not support a place for the regime on that list. At the time, Cuba shared the list with Iran, Syria, North Korea and Sudan; the administration of President Donald Trump removed Sudan from the list in 2020. Since Obamas decision to remove Cuba, reports have repeatedly indicated that Cuba has direct ties to the Shiite jihadist organization Hezbollah, including reports linking Cuban funding to the creation of Venezuelan passport machines that ultimately created fraudulent documentation for Hezbollah members from the Middle East. The Castro regime has also never hidden its support for the FARC, a Marxist terrorist organization, including allowing prominent FARC leaders to march in its parades after Obama removed it from the state sponsors of terrorism list. In announcing the designation Monday, Pompeo said in a statement that the move was necessary in light of the Communist Party of Cuba ""repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists."" ""The Trump Administration has been focused from the start on denying the Castro regime the resources it uses to oppress its people at home, and countering its malign interference in Venezuela and the rest of the Western Hemisphere,"" Pompeo noted. Countries on the list of state sponsors of terrorism are subject to ""restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance; a ban on defense exports and sales; certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions,"" according to the State Department. Obamas decision to strip Cuba of those sanctions followed an announcement in 2014 that his administration would actively court the Castro regime through economic incentives in the hopes of convincing it to improve its human rights record. Obama personally visited Havana in 2016 and met with Raul Castro, attending a baseball game and doing ""the wave"" together. The Obama policies resulted in skyrocketing numbers of politically motivated arrests fueled by American celebrity tourism to Havana. Tourism to Cuba by U.S. citizens is technically illegal, but under Obama celebrities could claim a ""people to people"" exception to the ban to enjoy Cubas hospitality and entertainment offerings, almost universally owned by the Cuban military. Obama also legalized cruises to Cuba, which would necessarily use ports stolen from American citizens to dock there, without paying the true owners. When the Obama State Department announced the removal of Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list in 2015, the Castro regime was heavily involved in negotiations between the FARC and the Colombian government, on behalf of the terrorist organization. Cuba played a significant role as mediator in those talks, which resulted in a ""peace deal,"" rejected by the Colombian people, that legalized the FARC and allowed its senior leaders to receive uncontested Colombian Senate and House seats without fully abandoning terrorist activities or facing prison time for their crimes. As of 2020, several senior FARC ""senators"" have declared war on Colombia once again and are believed to be hiding out in Venezuela, which is almost fully controlled by the Cuban communist regime. Current Colombian President Ivan Duque accused Cuba in 2019 of helping Marxist terrorists who bombed a police station in Bogota -- this time not believed to be members of the FARC but of the Marxist terrorist rival, National Liberation Army (ELN). The Castro regime, a prominent ally of terrorist Iran, is also believed to have close ties to Hezbollah, which also operates in Venezuela. In 2016, U.K.-based outlet Asharq Al-Awsat accused Cuba of bankrolling a scheme for Venezuela to issue authentic government passports to members of Hezbollah who had never been to Venezuela and had no ties to the country. Two months after that report, the ""Panama Papers,"" a series of leaks from the now-defunct international firm Mossack Fonseca published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), appeared to confirm the allegation. The ""Panama Papers"" revealed that, under Hugo Chavez, Venezuela purchased advanced technology to overhaul the Venezuelan passport system. Chavez reportedly convinced the Cuban government to help, but given sanctions on Havana, Mossack Fonseca had to employ a money scheme known as a ""financial bicycle"" to obscure the origin of the cash. By the time the Panama Papers were published, at least one Venezuelan diplomat, Misael Lopez Soto of the Baghdad embassy, confirmed that the embassy was selling passports, birth certificates, and other legal documentation to non-Venezuelan Middle Eastern citizens in exchange for bribes, many of them believed to have ties to jihadist groups. Last year, the Castro regime forced citizens to sign a ""condolence book"" in the aftermath of a U.S. airstrike against Qasem Soleimani, the head of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force. The IRGC is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
Cuba's medical revolution takes on Covid-19 and Big Pharma,https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/cuba-s-medical-revolution-takes-on-covid-19-and-big-pharma-44001,02/08/21,www.trtworld.com,"Insight The plucky island nation has overcome debilitating sanctions and is now on the cusp of producing a working vaccine against the coronavirus. Ihosvany Castellanos Santos is apologetic about responding late to messages, the internet is expensive and the economic situation in Cuba is far from good. That, however, hasn't stopped the country from becoming an unlikely contender in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine. Santos, an associate professor at the countrys health institute is optimistic of the strides his country has made in trials towards a working Covid-19 vaccine. The government-backed Finlay Vaccine Institute (IFV) has produced a vaccine that is currently entering Phase 3 trials. While Latin American heavyweights Brazil and Mexico vie for supply deals from Western, Chinese and Russian pharmaceutical companies Cuba has four prospective vaccines in the pipeline. The ""Sovereign 02"" as one of the vaccines is called, alludes to what it means for this small island nation to achieve a meaningful working vaccine given its superpower neighbours attempt to economically cripple the country over the last six decades. The Sovereign 02 is also furthest ahead in the trials. Cuba, Santos tells TRT World, decided to invest in its own vaccine due to the ""financial persecution"" the country faces from the United States, which subjected the country to ""economic, commercial and financial blockades."" US sanctions on the communist country include food and medicine which, according to a report, has dramatically harmed the ""health and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary Cuban citizens."" Those same ""hostile policies"" that have prevented ordinary Cubans from accessing healthcare are now also making it hard for the country to speed up vaccine research, says Santos. ""Since the clinical trials began on August 24, 2020, it [Sovereign 02] reports zero serious adverse events after the injection of the first volunteers,"" says Santos adding ""what is normally done in years has been accomplished in just under three months."" Cuba, in the world of medicine, is known for offering high-quality healthcare at a low cost, in particular for developing countries. The country boasts thousands of doctors working from Africa to Latin America and Asia providing primary care to millions of people - those networks and relationships may well be a template if its Covid-19 vaccine proves to be a success. Cubas march at the ""forefront in the scientific-health field"" says Santos ""is the result of a long accumulated experience in preventive medicine, mass immunisation and the development of a biotechnology industry of undeniable international prestige."" In a visit to the country in 2014, the then director general of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan, declared ""Cuba is the only country that has a health care system closely linked to research and development. This is the way to go, because human health can only improve through innovation."" That accumulated knowledge and self-sufficiency over decades, along with a determination to improve the life expectancy of its people despite sanctions, have undoubtedly contributed to the country's seemingly early success. Now Cuba has entered into a partnership with another unlikely country, Iran, where its conducting Phase 3 trials of the Sovereign 02 vaccine. Cuba, with only 238 Covid-19 related deaths and less than 33,000 infections doesnt have enough patients to test the vaccine on in a controlled trial. Iran, another country that has faced crippling medical sanctions by the US continues to have several thousand cases per day. Tehran has already complained that the US has made the countrys efforts to deal with the virus worse by pressuring companies not to trade with Iran. The countrys Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has banned the use of Western vaccines in the country branding them as ""untrustworthy,"" meaning that the country will have to rely on the Russian, Chinese and now perhaps the Cuban vaccine. Cuba, already indigenously manufactures several vaccines for its national immunisation programme which is free and universal, and covers 98 percent of the population says Santos. ""In 1990, Cuba produced its own vaccine against Hepatitis B, practically achieving the disappearance of that disease, we also have several vaccines against different types of cancer and against diabetes,"" adds Santos. ""In case of a happy ending, Cuba will have its own vaccine against the coronavirus available to the population in the first quarter of 2021,"" he says. If Sovereign 02 is successful, the country plans to produce 100 million vaccines this year. The vaccine could prove crucial to Latin American countries struggling to contain the virus while Western countries hoard most of the Covid-19 vaccines. Cubas medical revolution ""marches once again"" says Santos optimistically. Source: TRT World",
"Cuba, Failing to Sell Bogus Coronavirus 'Cure,' Shops Vaccine Candidate to Suriname",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/03/02/cuba-failing-to-sell-bogus-coronavirus-cure-shops-vaccine-candidate-to-suriname/,03/02/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Communist Party of Cuba is shopping around its four Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidates to impoverished neighbors, potentially selling its most developed one, ""Soberana 02,"" to Suriname, Diario de Cuba reported on Tuesday. Cuba boasts one of the worlds worst healthcare systems but invests heavily in foreign propaganda boasting of its allegedly superior medical schools and research institutions. It is the only Latin American country formally working on a vaccine against Chinese coronavirus. Soberana (""sovereign"") 02 entered late-stage clinical trials this week. Prior to its promotion of the vaccine candidates, the Cuban government attempted to attract the worlds attention claiming that interferons, a form of antiviral, could be used to fight coronavirus infections. Cuba remains the only nation to promote the use of interferons in this manner; doctors abroad condemned Havana for promoting a dangerous and possibly lethal unproven treatment. ""When the Government of Cuba assures that the Interferon developed in Cuba cures the coronavirus, it is committing a serious crime against world public health, since this drug not only lacks any scientific proof, but also where it has been tested has already given null results of encouragement,"" a group of doctors wrote in an article shared with the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders. Diario de Cuba cited the Castro regimes ambassador to Paramaribo, Suriname, as the source for the promise on behalf of the regime to grant Suriname access to its vaccine candidates. The ambassador, Igor Azcuy, met with the head of the nations parliament, Gregory Rusland, this week. According to a readout of that meeting published by Cubas Ministry of External Relations (Minrex), the two discussed ""the situation of Cuba before the pandemic and the manufacture on the island of four vaccine projects."" The statement did not elaborate further on what, exactly, the two discussed regarding the vaccines, and continued noting that the two also discussed Cubas hostile relationship with the United States and its ""eventual improvement ... under the new government of the U.S."" President Joe Biden served as vice president during the tenure of President Barack Obama, who granted the Castro regime unprecedented concessions, like the legalization of tourist cruises to the island, that generated millions in revenue for the regime. President Donald Trump largely revoked those concessions, leaving the Communist Party with minimal resources to repress its people. Diario de Cuba reported discussions with Suriname may result in the country receiving doses of one of the four vaccine candidates by the second half of 2021, citing Prensa Latina, a Cuban regime outlet. The newspaper also noted Cuban officials have hinted to Cubas desire to sell its vaccine candidates to ""friendly countries,"" claiming it will be able to manufacture enough doses for the entire island without having to worry about selling abroad. Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, announced Phase III clinical trials for Soberana 02 to begin this week. Another vaccine candidate, ""Abdala,"" has reportedly already begun ""industrial-scale production,"" despite not finishing clinical trials. Cuban doctors will inject 44,000 people with Soberana 02 as part of its Phase III, and over 300,000 doses of the vaccine are ready. Cubas candidate will compete with an array of international contenders, the most successful of which so far appears to be the coronavirus vaccine developed by the American company Pfizer, which boasts 95-percent effectiveness. The Communist Party of China has approved two vaccines, by firms Sinovac and Sinopharm, respectively, that are significantly less effective. China is planning to import at least 100 million doses of the Pfizer product through its European partner, BioNTech. Cuban officials have claimed that, unlike most currently available vaccines, the Cuban products show significant success rates against new variants of the original Chinese coronavirus found in South Africa and Brazil. ""Cuba will be one of the first nations to immunize its entire population,"" Eduardo Martinez, president of the government-run BioCubaFarma, said in early February. Cuban officials have not revealed any specific plans for distributing its own vaccine candidates - or any other vaccines - to its people. Cuba has a poor record with routine vaccinations, as its healthcare system has been on the brink of collapse for decades. In a notable recent incident, Cuban doctors killed a one-year-old, Paloma Dominguez Caballero, with a routine Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine. After demanding an explanation for her death for weeks, Dominguezs parents were forced to flee the country due to government intimidation. They never received an explanation for their daughters death, though some suggested either the vaccine dose was faulty or it was poorly refrigerated. Cuban officials have hinted, without a plan for vaccinating citizens, wealthy tourists may be eligible to receive approved coronavirus vaccine candidates. Cuba documented more Chinese coronavirus cases in February than any other month prior, according to Granma. Doctors confirmed 22,998 cases of infection that month, compared to 15,536 in January. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Communist Party initially attempted to profit by advertising itself as open to tourism, prompting nationwide protests. Havana reversed course after documenting its first cases, all Italian tourists, in March 2020. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
The scene from Cuba: How it's getting so much right on COVID-19,https://theconversation.com/the-scene-from-cuba-how-its-getting-so-much-right-on-covid-19-155699,03/16/21,theconversation.com,"As the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harms underprivileged people globally, Cubas ""people over profit"" approach has been saving many lives -- both on the island and abroad. From the onset, Cubas approach has been holistic and integrated. Its response is among the most respected in the world. Widespread confidence in the Cuban governments science-based policies, public service media messaging and volunteerism are key reasons as to why Cuba has been able to control the viral reproduction rate until mass vaccination begins. The cash-strapped Caribbean island risked opening to holiday visitors at the end of 2020 and is currently managing higher COVID-19 caseloads than ever before. Its health experts are combining international clinical trials of its vaccine candidates with mass production. Cuba is the only Latin American country with the capacity to manufacture a vaccine domestically other than Brazil, which is not doing so. Cuba aims to protect its populace, then give away or sell its vaccines abroad. (Yamil Lage) Before the viruss arrival in Cuba, the country prepared for mitigation based on best practices from Asia and its own expertise with contagious disease. Beyond Cubas borders, its medical diplomacy took over. Cubas Henry Reeve Medical Brigade has been fighting the pandemic in at least 37 countries and has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. When COVID-19 stranded the cruise ship MS Braemar, only Cuba allowed it to dock. In contrast, many countries pandemic responses have been haphazard, with well-funded lobby groups representing restaurants and pharmaceutical companies, to name just two sectors, wielding excessive influence. Oscillating virus reproduction rates have required disruptive and costly mitigation measures and resulted in illness and death. The media, academics who include Helen Yaffe, Emily Morris and John Kirk and non-governmental organizations like Havana and Oakland-based Medicc have long documented Cubas emulation-worthy health system. Read more: Coronavirus response: why Cuba is such an interesting case Hard work, hard science Care in Cuba is universal, research and training is robust and disease and disaster mitigation is well-organized. The public health-care system is co-ordinated across research institutes and centres of disease control, through to dispersed local neighbourhood clinics. Cuba also has a near 100 per cent literacy rate, with much attention paid to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Cubas achievements are the result of hard work and hard science in a not-for-profit system. The populaces confidence has been earned through science-based campaigns against the likes of HIV, Ebola, dengue fever and the Zika virus. Nations that have responded well to the pandemic have communicated clearly and factually with their people. Cuba has a tradition of multi-pronged public-service messaging. The countrys epidemiology director has become a trusted household expert through his daily news reports. Every day at 9 a.m., a seated and masked Dr. Francisco Duran speaks directly to the public, noting and lamenting every fatality, detailing disease spread and treatments, answering viewer questions and sternly advising continued adherence to preventative measures. The well-known psychologist Manuel Calvino discusses topics such as self-discipline and positive thinking. Cheerier spots feature famous actors urging fortitude and depict groups of people following health protocols. In cartoons, angry ""red meanie"" viruses are drowned by hand-washing and blocked by face masks, animation heroes celebrate International Workers Day from their balconies, youngsters stay home to protect their grandparents and families play inside together. The socially distanced 42nd International Festival of New Latin American Cinema featured animated doctors orders in its promotional video. Ubiquitously stated, sung and danced slogans include ""Cuba for life, with a new (masked) smile."" Mask-wearing is popular I surveyed residents of Havana online and later in-person while in Cuba in December and January. Most reported wearing masks to ""protect others and myself."" While masking has been broadly politicized elsewhere, Cuba mandated masks in March 2020, immediately sharing instructions on how to make them at home. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) While in many countries volunteers struggled to find ways to help, in Cuba, existing organizations such as neighbourhood watches and universities quickly moved into action. Medical students have gone door-to-door checking for symptoms. Computer science students have developed helpful apps and supported medical staff in their dorms-turned-quarantine centres. Necessary work got done while public buy-in solidified the mitigation efforts. The initial growth curve was inverted early on. Banking on individual responsibility among its well-educated citizens, Cuba shifted to a ""new normal"" at the year-end holiday season. Tourists headed to isolated beach resorts and expats to their relatives homes. The hotels follow health protocols meticulously -- speedy PCR testing, masking, sanitation and social distancing. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) But family visits led to outbreaks, as they have globally. Some visitors, many of them arriving from areas with high rates of infection and science denial such as Miami, breached the requisite protocols: one PCR test with a negative result upon arrival, a five-day home quarantine and another negative PCR test before mingling. Pandemic has been costly All indicators show Cuba has put its limited resources to efficient use for the public good. But especially coupled with former U.S. president Donald Trumps tightening of the American blockade against Cuba, the pandemic and the resulting plunge in tourism are costly. Scarcity of affordable food and consumer goods, along with an increased cost of living accelerated by a long-overdue monetary unification, have increased stress levels. Read more: U.S.-Cuba relations: Will Joe Biden pick up where Barack Obama left off? Sensing an opportunity, foreign interest groups are supporting small, lively social media and in-person protests, most characterized by vociferous yet vague demands for artistic freedom. Daily cases are also now hovering around 850 compared to 42 on Nov. 15, 2020 -- just before Havanas airport reopened. Although the curve is again flat -- exponential growth has been halted for the second time -- medical personnel and supplies are strained. Against this backdrop, however, there are Cubas advances on the vaccination front. In this breakneck race, Cuba is simultaneously running Phase 3 international clinical trials of Soberana (Sovereignty) 2 and, planned for late March, Abdala, with robust production of these vaccine candidates. Work is also continuing on Soberana 1 and Mambisa. Looking ahead to COVID-19 variants and reinfections, a booster Soberana Plus is now being developed. If Cubas vaccination program is successful, the country will have once again provided for its people against enormous odds as it produces and distributes a vaccine domestically, then shares it with the world. Many market-driven, rich nations of the Global North, including Canada, are not so well-positioned. Cubas access to internationally produced vaccines was highly improbable due to the U.S. blockade. Its ensuing decision to make its own vaccines stands to pay off handsomely.",
Feature: Cuba's Communist Party to hold Congress amid COVID-19 pandemic - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-04/12/c_139874920.htm,04/12/21,www.xinhuanet.com,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-04-12 13:49:14|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- With less than one week away, the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) has started the countdown to its eighth Congress scheduled for April 16-19. The meeting will take place as the island nation marks the 60th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion, where Cuban revolutionary forces defeated U.S.-backed mercenaries aiming to overthrow the socialist revolution. As national flags wave from public institutions and balconies, Havana's main avenues are flanked by the phrase ""The Party is the soul of the Revolution"" on red-colored billboards. ""This patriotic message reminds us that the Communist Party is fundamental for the defense of our political system,"" said Marcelo Ramirez, a private sector employee living in central Havana, after reading the patriotic slogan on a billboard near the city's entertainment district. Fabio Fernandez, a senior professor with the School of Philosophy and History at the University of Havana, told Xinhua that the Eighth Congress of the PCC would be crucial to speeding up social and economic reforms started on the island a decade ago. ""The Communist Party of Cuba is called on to promote discussion on topics of current national interest,"" he said, adding that the political organization must ensure the fulfillment of the new Cuban Constitution approved in 2019. It comes in the middle of the island nation's efforts to contain its sharpest rise in COVID-19 infections since the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Cuba on March 11, 2020. On top of that, the Cuban people went through a harsh economic period, partly due to the tightening of the U.S. embargo against the Caribbean nation. Gathered at Havana's Conventions Center, delegates will discuss ideology, history, cultural institutions' work, battle against corruption, aside from other topics concerning the internal functioning of political organizations, according to local media. In addition, economic transformations implemented over the past five years, foreign investment, the new legal framework for non-state businesses, and the ongoing monetary reform will be on the agenda. Oscar Fernandez, a senior professor with the School of Economics at the University of Havana, said that the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba will have to make strategic decisions within a very serious economic context. ""I expect the Congress can contribute to consolidating the path of the economic reform. It is also important that indicators to measure the success of the economic and social changes be defined more clearly,"" he added. Enditem",
Cuba to enter post-Castro era at pivotal 2021 party congress,https://www.reuters.com/world/cuba-enter-post-castro-era-pivotal-2021-party-congress-2021-04-13/,04/13/21,www.reuters.com,"A picture of former Cuban President Raul Castro is displayed in the window of a state building in Havana, Cuba, April 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, April 13 (Reuters) - Cuba is poised to enter the post-Castro era with Raul Castro due to step down as head of the ruling Communist Party at its congress this week, which will also address the island's severe economic crisis, pandemic response and signs of growing dissent. Castro, 89, and his late older brother Fidel have successively ruled Cuba ever since leading a 1959 revolution that toppled a U.S.-backed dictator and installed a Communist-run country on the doorstep of the United States. The congress, which takes place every five years, is the Communist party's most important meeting electing party leadership and setting policy guidelines. Raul Castro said at the 2016 congress it would be the last one led by the so-called ""historic generation"" of revolutionary veterans. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register The new generation of younger leaders is not expected to make sweeping changes to Cuba's one-party, socialist model. But it will be under pressure to pursue further market-style reforms to the long-ailing, centrally planned economy, Cuban analysts said. The April 16-19 congress comes as Cubans battle worsening widespread shortages of basic goods, including food and medicine, after a liquidity crisis was exacerbated by a tightening of decades-old U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic. Hints on the reform path to come could be delivered at the meeting, the analysts said. But many Cubans say they are not hopeful much will change any time soon. Guidelines around the first moves to open the economy, announced in 2011, have still only been 70% implemented, according to the party. ""A lot of my generation feel frustrated with the pace of change,"" said Jorge Quintana, 35, a Havana resident standing in an hours-long queue for detergent. ""Many have emigrated looking for a new path."" Castro is expected to hand over the leadership of the Communist Party, the most powerful position in the island nation of 11 million, to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who in 2018 already inherited the presidency. Diaz-Canel is under pressure to deliver results to retain support because he does not have the moral legitimacy of the historic generation, the analysts said. Social reforms over the past decade, in particular the expansion of Internet access, have strengthened Cuban civil society. Small protests have cropped up nationwide lately despite tight control by authorities of public spaces. read more Some dissidents at home and abroad say the time for democratic change has come and are urging U.S. President Joe Biden, who promised during his election campaign last year to ease sanctions, to keep the pressure on. HARDLINERS VS REFORMERS Hundreds of party delegates elected by card-carrying members will discuss the update of Cuba's economic model as well as other matters like online ""ideological subversion"" and the pandemic, party newspaper Granma wrote in March. Cuba, which prides itself on its healthcare, has one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates in the region. It also sent thousands of doctors to help other countries and has two homegrown vaccines in late phase trials. Still, the congress coincides with a time of rising cases - over 900 new infections a day. However, the economy remains Cuba's top challenge, Diaz-Canel was cited as saying by Granma. The economy shrank 11% last year as the pandemic devastated tourism. The crisis has already pushed the government to resume economic reforms, most notably a painful monetary overhaul. ""The strategic economic changes were defined in the two previous congresses,"" said Cuba expert Arturo Lopez-Levy of the Holy Names University in California. ""Now it's fundamentally about discussing how to implement them."" Diaz-Canel has sought to win the party's trust with his government's catchphrase ""We are continuity,"" said Lopez-Levy. The party's divisions derive not so much from a generational gap as disagreement between reformers and those who fear less state control of the economy means less political control, said former Cuban diplomat and analyst Carlos Alzugaray. Alzugaray said he hoped the congress would show the party was prepared to take bolder reforms, widely backed by Cuban economists, involving decentralizing the economy, giving state enterprises greater autonomy, and allowing the private sector to work unfettered. Raul Castro, meanwhile, would retire but not disappear, he said. ""He will stay as a figure,"" Alzugaray said. ""The final port of appeal in the case of any conflict that may emerge.""

"Cuba's Raul Castro steps down, ending the era of his famous clan at the country's helm",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/americas/cuba-raul-castro-communist-leader-intl-latam/index.html,04/15/21,www.cnn.com,"Havana (CNN) When Raul Castro announced three years ago that he would step down in 2021 as head of Cuba's all-powerful communist party, he surely envisioned the island on firmer economic footing and the transition to a new generation of leadership nearly complete. Things have not worked out exactly according to Castro's plan. As Castro announced he was stepping down on Friday, his country is deep in crisis. The tourism-dependent island has been battered by the pandemic; the economy shrunk at least 11% in 2020 according to government estimates. Cubans each day spend hours in long lines to find increasingly scarce food, medicine and other necessities. While Cuban officials have made an all-out effort to thwart the spread of the coronavirus, cases are at an all-time high on the island. It will likely take many more months to know if Cuba's ambitious, ""Hail Mary"" plan to develop the island's own homegrown vaccines will prove successful. With then-US President Barack Obama, Castro mended long fraught US-Cuban relations, only to see those ties blown up again under the Trump administration which enacted some of the toughest economic penalties on the island in decades. But so far, current President Joe Biden has been reluctant to engage with the communist-run island despite the most significant change in leadership in Cuba in decades. ""Regardless of what administration we have, Republican or Democrat, it's a good time to engage,"" said former Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a rare member of the GOP to push for improved relations, who met with Raul Castro during frequent trips to Cuba. ""It benefits the Cuban people and puts pressure on the Cuban government that they don't have when we try to isolate them."" It's difficult to imagine a more precarious time for the last members of the aging generation that transformed Cuba into a socialist state to finally relax their hold on power. Despite deepening uncertainty, Cubans witnessed an historic changing of the guard at this week's 8th Congress for the Cuban Communist Party, ""the supreme body"" of the only political party permitted on the island. The congress started Friday, timed to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Cuba's victory over CIA-trained exiles during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Even if the outgoing head of the party's family continues to wield unquestionable power on the island, once the congress is over, no one with the last name Castro will occupy a senior position of leadership for the first time in over 62 years. JUST WATCHED Cubans face an impossible choice: Go hungry or risk virus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cubans face an impossible choice: Go hungry or risk virus 02:53 Since the early years of the revolution, Cuba's head of state has always led the party, making it nearly impossible to determine where the government ends and the party begins. But in 2018, Castro stepped down as president, making way for his handpicked successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel, to take over running the day-to-day management of the government. Castro stayed as head of the party, which oversees long term planning, but said Diaz-Canel would likely assume that position too in 2021 ""After that,"" Castro said in 2018, ""If my health permits it, I will be just one more soldier with the people, defending this revolution."" His departure brings an end to the era of his famous clan occupying the top leadership on the island. None of the children of Castro's older brother, Fidel, who died in 2016, hold government posts. Raul Castro's son, Alejandro, is a colonel in Cuba's Interior Ministry and his daughter, Mariela, runs a government center promoting LGBTQ rights. A son-in-law, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez-Callejas, heads a sprawling military company that controls state-owned hotels, marinas and infrastructure projects but he maintains a low public profile. Cuba is one of the countries that has changed the least since the end of the Cold War, even as government officials acknowledge the island desperately needs to adapt. Finding the path to modernizing Cuba's economy will now fall squarely on the shoulders of Miguel Diaz-Canel, Castro's successor as president who is expected to take over as head of the communist party. Trained as an electrical engineer, Diaz-Canel ran local governments in two provinces before becoming minister of higher education and then vice president and president. Diaz-Canel is the first Cuban who was born after the 1959 revolution to become president. Gaining the leadership of the party will further establish the tall, grey-haired technocrat as the political heir to the Castros. But it remains unclear how he differs from his predecessors. ""I believe in continuity,"" Diaz-Canel told reporters in 2018 when asked about his vision for Cuba's future. ""I think there always will be continuity."" Diaz-Canel has tried to project a more active image to the Cuban public, posting on Twitter regularly. He immediately visited the still-smoldering scene of a passenger plane crash in 2018 in Havana that killed 112 people, and he holds cabinet meetings across the island as Fidel Castro used to. JUST WATCHED CNN granted rare access to Cuban presidential tour Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN granted rare access to Cuban presidential tour 03:19 The optics may have changed somewhat but Diaz-Canel is a vocal adherent to the ideology that rigid state control of the economy remains the best way forward for Cuba, despite decades of stagnant economic growth. And any public opposition to the party line, he has said, is the work of Cubans who are ""mal nacidos"" or born in the wrong country. Even with all the official talk of maintaining the course, Cuba is changing. Many in Cuba's nascent private sector complain openly about the slow pace of reforms.

Yamil Lage/Pool via Reuters/File Photo HAVANA, April 16 (Reuters) - Raul Castro confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress that kicked off on Friday, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel. In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said the new leadership would be party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit.""

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register He already handed over the presidency in 2018 to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who ran the party in two provinces before joining the national government. The new generation of leaders, which did not forge itself through rebellion, has no easy task. The transition comes as Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, while there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana. The congress, the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership, is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television. Castro himself became acting president when Fidel fell ill in 2006 and later in 2011 party leader, launching a raft of social and economic reforms to open up one of the world's last Communist-run countries that later stalled. On Friday, he hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders that was picking up where he left off. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system. Older Cubans said they would miss having a Castro at the helm, although most acknowledged it was time to pass on the baton. ""It's another stage,"" said Maria del Carmen Jimenez, a 72-year old retired nurse, ""but without a double we will miss him."" Castro denounced renewed U.S. hostility under former President Donald Trump. Incumbent President Joe Biden has vowed to roll back some of Trumps sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities. Castro said Cuba was ready for a ""new type of relationship with the United States without ... Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism."" PRESSURE TO REFORM Cuba's new leaders face pressure to speed up reform, particularly economic change, which is foremost on citizens' minds, especially younger Cubans who have known only crisis, analysts say. A tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in Cuba's ailing centrally planned economy. Shortages of even basic goods mean Cubans spend hours lining up to buy groceries. And Havana has dollarized parts of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy. Since the expansion of internet access in recent years, Cubans are increasingly using social media as a platform to express criticism, while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media. Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide on issues as varied as excessive red tape to curbs on civil liberties. Castro said on Friday it was important to pursue reform with greater ""dynamism"", denouncing - as he has in the past - ""inertia, conformism, the lack of initiative"" in state companies. The government has resumed a set of economic reforms the party agreed on at its 2011 congress in recent months, in particular eradicating Cuba's dual currency, multiple exchange rate system in January. Yet Castro said reforms fomenting the non-state sector should not go beyond certain limits that would lead to the ""very destruction of socialism and the end of national sovereignty."" Party militants like Rogelio Machado, a mathematics teacher, say they were confident the new generation was up to walking that tightrope. ""Our country need changes and the new generation is more scientifically prepared to continue the path of socialism,"" he said. But government critics like ""artivist"" Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom Havana accuses of being part of a U.S.-backed soft coup attempt, say the death knell is sounding for the revolution. ""Raul is passing over the power to someone with little charisma and who does not have much popular support,"" he said while staging his latest performance against the government, in which he sits in a garrote for the four days of the congress. ""This takes us one step closer to democracy.""

Raul Castro confirms he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/raul-castro-cuba-communist-party-resigning,04/16/21,www.theguardian.com,"Raul Castro has confirmed that he is resigning as head of Cubas Communist party, ending an era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution. The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement on Friday in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party - the only one allowed on the island. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana. He said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland"". Castro did not say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cubas one-party system. His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades, Cubans will not have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead. The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality. Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy. In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the islands dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise - a category long banned or tightly restricted - permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes. This years congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities. The Communist party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cubas constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society. Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism. He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the countrys unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution. Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016.",

Small changes The PCC has said its congress, held 60 years after Fidel Castro officially declared Cuba's government a socialist one, would ""review core issues of the political, economic and social life of the country."" There are some signs that Cuba's leadership will have little choice but to increasingly balance the interests of the old guard with a clamor for more rights and better quality of life from younger generations. In February, it opened the bulk of its government-monopolised economy to entrepreneurs in the private sector. There have also been small nods to social liberalisation. In recent months, the government held its first-ever talks, though short-lived, with pro-free speech protesters, after authorising in 2019 Cuba's first non-political demonstration, by animal rights activists. 'Subversion' The arrival of the internet on mobile phones at the end of 2018 has made for a paradigm shift in Cuba, with never-before-seen access to information and new forums for expression and even limited protest. In response, the PCC has said one of the functions of its congress would be ""confronting political and ideological subversion, which has made the internet and social media its principal field of operations."" Castro told the congress he was retiring as ""a simple revolutionary fighter. ""Let there be no doubt, as long as I live, I will be ready... to defend the homeland, revolution and socialism,"" he said to loud applause.

(Ariel Royero/Prensa Latina/Handout via Xinhua) by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) kicked off Friday at Havana's Convention Center, chaired by Raul Castro, first secretary of the PCC's Central Committee, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel. During the presentation of the Central Report to the Eighth Congress of the PCC, Castro said that Cuba has preserved important social achievements in education, healthcare and social security, despite the intensification of the U.S. embargo against the island. Castro, 89, expressed his ""will to develop a respectful dialogue and build a new type of relationship with the United States,"" saying, ""Cuba will not give up on the principles of the Revolution and socialism."" He also called for improving the performance of the local economy and consolidating relations with governments and parties from different nations, including China. ""As far as I am concerned, my work as the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba has come to an end, with the satisfaction of having accomplished my duty and with confidence in the future of the homeland,"" he added. The Congress takes place as the island marks the 60th anniversary of the victory against the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion and the declaration of Cuban socialism. With senior party leaders and delegates from all over the island in attendance, the meeting is scheduled to conclude on Monday. Addressing the audience during the opening speech, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, second secretary of the Central Committee of PCC, said that the political organization ""guarantees national unity and represents the ideals of dignity, justice and social independence"" for which generations of Cuban patriots have fought. Wearing face masks and abiding by social distancing guidelines, delegates discussed ideology, updating of the Cuban model, internal functioning of the PCC as well as the economic transformations implemented over the past five years since the last party congress. ""Dreaming and pushing a country forward: Our eighth Congress of the PCC starts today, the congress of continuity. It is here where ideas are rooted, history is acknowledged and the future is discussed. We are Cuba, we are continuity,"" Diaz-Canel said on Twitter earlier on Friday. Iroel Sanchez, a Cuban political commentator, told Xinhua that the Cuban Revolution will not only continue to stand on its own feet but actually has a lot to offer to a world that needs the Caribbean nation's example. ""We have many challenges ahead, but the Cuban people have shown evidence of huge reservoirs of intelligence and humanism instilled in it by socialism,"" he said. Nationwide, Cubans followed news on the opening ceremony of the Congress through state media's coverage. Among them is PCC member Sonia Cruz, a 60-year-old state employee from Havana's 10 de Octubre district. ""This is a historic Congress for Cubans who are called to continue defending the social achievements of our socialist system,"" she said, adding, ""The Communist Party of Cuba guarantees unity and continuity of the Cuban Revolution.""

By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's Communist Party kicked off a historic four-day congress on Friday that will see the last Castro exiting the political stage after six decades of rule by brothers Fidel and Raul following their 1959 leftist revolution. Raul Castro, 89, has signaled he will step aside as Communist Party first secretary, the most powerful job in Cuba. The congress takes place every five years for the organization to review policy and name its leadership. While the congress takes place behind closed doors, the party tweeted a video showing hundreds of delegates at a convention center in Havana greeting Castro with a standing ovation early on Friday. Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who is widely expected to take over the party leadership. The new generation of leaders, which did not forge itself through rebellion against a U.S.-backed dictatorship like the ""historic generation,"" will have no easy task. The congress takes place as Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, and there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans. ""My generation does not want to take the dull path of my parents' generation,"" said Havana resident Guillermo Estrada, 31, adding he had no idea what would arise from the congress as it was all so secretive. ""I wish for a better future without so many internal and external restrictions."" New U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in the ailing centrally planned economy, which was already struggling following a decline in Venezuelan aid. That has led to shortages of even basic goods, with many Cubans spend hours lining up to buy groceries. The dire situation has pushed the government to speed up the implementation of long-planned reforms, which have proven painful. A monetary overhaul this year sent inflation soaring four or fivefold, according to economists. Havana has dollarized much of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or who did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy. ""The party congress is taking place in one of the most complex situations the revolution has had,"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny. Social reforms Raul Castro took after inheriting the party leadership from his brother Fidel in 2008, in particular the expansion of internet on the island, have opened up society. Cubans are increasingly expressing criticism on social media while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media. Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide. ""You cannot only control with repression, you need prosperity and hope,"" said Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, 33, a dissident artist who has become one of the best known faces of an 'artivist' movement challenging the government, partly through performances. Diaz-Canel, a party loyalist who already inherited the presidency from Raul Castro in 2018, has been careful to underscore the continuity of policy throughout the transition, dubbing this weekend's party meeting the ""congress of continuity."" Yet he will have to prove himself, in particular in terms of improving the economy, to retain popular support, say analysts. Cuba experts will carefully scrutinize other senior party appointments to assess whether Diaz-Canel will have backing to speed up the reforms - decentralization, autonomy for state companies, and reducing bureaucracy for private firms - demanded by economists.

""It's another stage,"" said Maria del Carmen Jimenez, a 72-year old retired nurse, ""but without a double we will miss him."" Castro denounced renewed U.S. hostility under former President Donald Trump. Incumbent President Joe Biden has vowed to roll back some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities. Castro said Cuba was ready for a ""new type of relationship with the United States without... Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism."" PRESSURE TO REFORM Cuba's new leaders face the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, while there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans. A tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in the ailing centrally planned economy, which was already struggling following a decline in Venezuelan aid. That has led to shortages of even basic goods, with many Cubans spending hours lining up to buy groceries. Those problems are foremost on citizens' minds, especially younger Cubans who have known only crisis, analysts said. ""I wish for a better future without so many internal and external restrictions,"" said Havana resident Guillermo Estrada, 31. Since the expansion of internet access in recent years, Cubans are increasingly using social media as a platform to express criticism, while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media. Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide. The dire economic situation has pushed the government to speed up the implementation of reforms first agreed by the party in 2011. A monetary overhaul this year sent inflation soaring four or fivefold, according to economists. Havana has dollarized parts of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or who did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy. Castro said on Friday it was important to speed up reforms, denouncing - as he has in the past - ""inertia, conformism, the lack of initiative"" in state companies. Yet he said reforms fomenting the non-state sector should not go beyond certain limits that would lead to the ""very destruction of socialism and the end of national sovereignty."" Party militants like Rogelio Machado, a mathematics teacher, say they were confident the new generation was up to walking that tricky tightrope. ""Our country need changes and the new generation is more scientifically prepared to continue the path of socialism,"" he said. But government critics like ""artivist"" Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom Havana accuses of being part of a U.S.-backed soft coup attempt, say the death knell is sounding for the revolution. ""Raul is passing over the power to someone with little charisma and who does not have much popular support,"" he said while staging his latest performance against the government, in which he sits in a garrote for the four days of the congress. ""This takes us one step closer to democracy.""

"As Cuba turns page on Castro era, economic reform gains urgency",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/17/as-cuba-turns-page-on-castro-era-economic-reform-gains-urgency,04/17/21,www.aljazeera.com,"The Cuban government outlined its planned economic reforms in 2011, but a decade later, implementation has been slow and the country is confronting new and dire challenges along with historic ones. Raul Castro has formally handed over the reins of Cubas Communist Party after decades as its first secretary, stepping down Friday during the first day of the partys eighth congress. The changing of the guard in the countrys most powerful institution represents a shift from the revolutionary leadership of the Castro era to a new generation. It also comes at a time when the countrys economy is struggling and in urgent need of reform. Cubas economy shrank by 11 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to government figures, and travel restrictions hit the islands tourism sector -- and the foreign currency it brings in -- particularly hard. But the pandemic is just the latest challenge facing Cubas economy. The countrys leadership has been slow to enact many incremental economic reforms laid out during its sixth congress in 2011. The ongoing United States embargo against the island, tightened by former US President Donald Trump, continues to bite. Meanwhile, shortages of essential goods including food and medicine -- a problem before COVID-19 -- have only worsened. Castro, 89, is expected to support Cubas current leader, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, as the next Communist Party secretary. Its a move, some analysts say, that could add a fresh sense of urgency to tackling the island nations festering economic problems. ""Raul Castro is transferring the authority to the next generation of leaders, and this is very important because the next generation of leaders rely on performance -- not on historical legacy -- to exercise power and as a source of legitimacy,"" Arturo Lopez-Levy, the author of Raul Castro and the New Cuba: A Close-Up View of Change and an assistant professor at Holy Names University, told Al Jazeera. Some experts think the transfer of authority could inject new thinking and new priorities into the leadership mix. ""Certainly theoretically, Diaz-Canel could now grab the reins and surround himself with his own team, and that is what hasnt happened yet, as far as we can see,"" Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of California San Diego and the author of Open for Business: Building the New Cuban Economy, told Al Jazeera. ""Economic policymaking, by and large, is in the hands of people who have been there for 20 years or more."" Investors, analysts and Cuban citizens will all be watching this weekends congress closely -- and seeing how many more of the countrys so-called ""historic generation"" actually depart, as Castro has. That, experts say, will be crucial to knowing whether economic change is actually in the cards or whether business will continue as usual. Sluggish reforms Back in 2011, then-President Raul Castro announced reforms aimed at bringing more market-oriented policies into Cubas historically socialist, state-run economy, including allowing people to set up small businesses and eliminating some of the governments notorious bureaucracy. ""Lets clean our heads of all sorts of nonsense,"" Castro said at the time. Cubans have come to expect long lines and shortages when it comes to food. Some, like Yuliet Colon, centre, have turned to Facebook to share recipes designed around the foods they are actually likely to find at the market or with government rations [File: Ramon Espinosa/AP Photo] But 10 years later, the failure to implement already announced reforms is likely ""a combination of inertia, lethargy, vested interests, self-interest and cowardice,"" Feinberg said, noting that inaction has left ""the Cuban people and the Cuban economy completely without resources: no foreign exchange, no international investment, little to no domestic investment"". One of the most urgent economic issues to be tackled is making sure people can feed themselves. The government seemed to acknowledge the urgency of the crisis after Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said this month: ""People do not eat plans."" Earlier this week, the Cuban government announced 63 measures to increase food production in the country, ""30 of which are considered priorities and some with immediate implementation"", state-owned newspaper Granma reported. But people in Cuba, already used to doing more with less because of the crippling US embargo, are frustrated with the pace of reform. To show he is serious about tackling the countrys economic woes, what Diaz-Canel ""needs to do is assemble a new, vigorous, younger, coherent team of economic decision-makers,"" Feinberg said. Currency transition No matter who is on it, the countrys economic team has a tough act to pull off, especially during a pandemic. ""Theyre undertaking reforms at the worst possible moment. They have no money,"" Feinberg said, adding that the country is nowhere close to joining the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, which could help with resources. Faced with the cash crunch, the Cuban government reallowed ""dollar stores"" last year that let people buy goods like food, toiletries and electronics with bank cards loaded with US dollars or other foreign currency. That, in turn, let the government snap up those dollars to help deal with its liquidity crisis. Experts say if Cuba manages to develop a successful COVID-19 vaccine, it could prove a valuable source of foreign currency as well. For now, the country is in the midst of a major currency transition, announcing in December that it was devaluing its peso for the first time since the 1959 revolution. Signs that read 'No CUC in reference to the Cuba convertible peso hang on the walls of a store in Havana, Cuba on December 11, 2020 [File: Ramon Espinosa/AP Photo] The island has used both the Cuban peso (CUP) and Cuban convertible peso (CUC) for years, with the latter used for state business and buying goods from abroad. Meanwhile, the CUP is still used for everyday domestic transactions, and many Cubans are paid their wages in that currency. Cubans have until the end of June to trade in CUCs for CUPs at the government-set exchange rate of 24 Cuban pesos to $1, which means Cubans whose savings are in CUCs will lose a significant amount in the conversion, something that is likely to hit workers in the tourism sector particularly hard. It has been a tough year for those workers, as the coronavirus decimated the countrys tourism-related businesses, which were already struggling after the Trump administration reimposed travel restrictions that had been loosened by US President Barack Obama. The Cuban government said it will publish the exchange rate for the Cuban peso daily on the website of the Central Bank of Cuba, signalling that it could potentially fluctuate rather than stay at its historically fixed rate -- something that could also make Cuba prone to inflation. Inflation could make the existing shortages of everyday goods -- exacerbated by the US embargo -- even worse. The currency devaluation also comes at a time when one of the countrys main supporters, Venezuela, is in little position to help as it battles its own US sanctions and hyperinflation, which has hit a whopping annual rate of 2,665 percent. Ongoing embargo US sanctions against Cuba have been in place since President John F Kennedy imposed a trade embargo in 1962 in the hopes of forcing the Castro brothers -- including Fidel, who was Cubas prime minister from 1959 to 1976 then its president until 2008; Raul, who took over from Fidel as the countrys president; and their oldest brother Ramon, who was active in the 1959 revolution -- from power. Republican and Democratic administrations have maintained the policy, with Trump tightening restrictions and redesignating Cuba a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" days before he left office. People with Cuban flags ride along the Malecon during a protest against the USs trade embargo on March 28 in Havana [File: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] The embargo clearly hasnt achieved its goal, but it has contributed to ordinary Cubans economic pain in the intervening decades, and this week, people took to the streets outside of the US embassy in Havana to call on President Joe Biden to end it. Mark Brennan, an adjunct associate professor of business ethics at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, said the Cuban government blames the embargo for too many of its economic problems. ""The regime has, since Castros time, used the American embargo, which they call a blockade, as the kind of reductionist explanation for every single problem on the island,"" Brennan told Al Jazeera, arguing that the countrys economic model was ""doomed from the get-go."" Still, Brennan believes ditching the embargo and pursuing ""complete and utter sheer openness"" would get the US more results. But ultimately, Lopez-Levy said, how and on what timeline economic reforms take place depends on Cuba, not on the wishes of foreign countries. Way forward A big part of the 1959 revolution was about not bowing to the wishes of the US or other powerful countries, and Cubans want to see reform done their way and to meet their own needs. In this March 14, 1957 photo, Fidel Castro, centre, stands with his brother Raul Castro, left, and Camilo Cienfuegos, right, while fighting against the government of Fulgencio Batista they eventually brought down in 1959 [File: Andrew St. George/AP Photo] ""The Cuban revolution was not something imposed from outside,"" Lopez-Levy said. ""There was a feeling among a large segment of the Cuban people that their country didnt belong to them, and that their country was at a level of subordination to the United States as a great power 90 miles north. That frustration was behind the revolution in a significant way, [and] in my opinion, it is more important than the communist ideology."" While working within the context of that legacy, the next generation of leaders must show Cubans they can enact real change in the areas of ""food security, energy security [and] transportation,"" Lopez-Levy explained, noting that the pace of those changes will depend on the communist partys ability to ""break the backbone of groups inside that are opposed to the necessary reforms"". Feinberg said it is possible for the island to move towards a market-oriented socialist economy, with a strong state-owned sector and strong regulatory authority existing alongside a significant and growing private sector that extends beyond the small businesses run from peoples homes that Diaz-Canel has legalised. But the current congress needs to respond to the urgency of the moment, and show it is serious about creating a legal framework for small and medium-sized private enterprises, allowing remittances from abroad and eliminating the red tape around foreign investment, including from the Cuban diaspora. Whether those types of major changes will be announced at the partys eighth congress, however, remains to be seen.",
Cuban Americans 'happy' to see end of Castro dynasty,https://nypost.com/2021/04/17/cuban-americans-happy-to-see-end-of-castro-dynasty/,04/17/21,nypost.com,"When Raul Castro announced the end of his family dynastys grip on power in Cuba, Horacio Llerena was happy to see him go. Llerena, a New Jersey contractor, escaped the Communist island as part of a mass migration of Cubans known as the Mariel boat lift in 1980, when Rauls brother Fidel Castro was at the helm. ""Were happy. Weve been waiting for it,"" said Llerena, 61, who was playing rummy with friends at the Jose Marti Park in Union City. The park features a bronze bust of the 19th century Cuban poet and patriot, who lived in exile in New York from 1880 until he returned to fight against Spanish imperialism in Cuba, where he died in 1895. Like Marti, Llerena originally moved to New York City from Havana. Llerena has lived in New Jersey since 1982, he said. Dubbed Havana on the Hudson, Union City and West New York have been home to a small Cuban community since the 1940s. Raul Castro gives a speech in 2019.

In 2008, Raul Castro took over Cubas leadership from his older brother Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader who had ruled the island since toppling the regime of Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Although Diaz-Canel is part of a younger generation of politicians on the island, he is serving at the behest of Raul Castro and is unlikely to make sweeping changes on the island, other Cuban American critics told The Post. Raul Castro announced his resignation on April 16, 2021. Ariel Ley/ACN/AFP via Getty Images ""They talk a good talk but I dont see any difference,"" said Tony, 52, a first-generation Cuban American who runs La Pola, his familys Cuban restaurant in West New York. In 2018, a Food Network critic called the restaurants Cuban sandwich the best in the US, sparking a feud with other Cuban communities in Florida. ""Its just one for passing the torch to another,"" said Tony about the handover of power on the island. Diaz-Canel will likely be elected as the secretary general of the Communist Party during this weekends party congress. Both the presidency and head of the party have been traditionally held by the same leader in the country.",
"Cuban dissidents decry harassment, as congress denounces 'counterrevolution' attempts",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-dissidents-decry-harassment-congress-denounces-counterrevolution-attempts-2021-04-18/,04/18/21,www.reuters.com,"A picture of former Cuban President Raul Castro is displayed in the window of a state building in Havana, Cuba, April 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, April 18 (Reuters) - Cuban dissidents accused authorities of cutting their web access and preventing them from leaving their homes during the Cuban Communist Party Congress where leaders denounced renewed U.S.-backed attempts at ""counterrevolution"" using online platforms. The four-day congress, where Raul Castro is set to step down as Communist Party leader, takes place amid a dire economic crisis that has fueled social discontent. U.S. sanctions and the pandemic have exacerbated the woes of the ailing state-run economy. The rollout of the internet has also provided new platforms for Cubans to express their frustrations in a one party system which tightly controls public spaces and boosted the growth of non-state media challenging a state monopoly of mass media. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register loading During a speech opening the congress on Friday, Castro warned the ""counterrevolution"" lacked popular support or leadership but was adept at manipulating the web. ""We are firmly convinced the streets, parks and squares belong to the revolutionaries and we will never deny our heroic people the right to defend its revolution,"" said Castro. The U.S. State Department has declined to directly address a Reuters' question about Havana's view that Washington and U.S. groups finance dissidents in a bid to destabilize it. ""We support those in civil society, in Cuba and around the world, who are defending their rights or struggling for freedom,"" a State Department spokesperson said earlier this month. So-called ""acts of repudiation"" when mobs of pro-government supporters show up to harass dissidents have made a comeback in Havana lately after years in which they were not deployed. Castro said counterrevolutionary groups were seeking to infiltrate and manipulate specific groups like the artistic or religious sectors in a bid to break national unity. The party passed a resolution on Sunday agreeing to strengthen ""revolutionary activism"" in social networks. Many of those who have denounced state harassment during the congress belong to the dissident artist collective the San Isidro Movement and 27N, a group of artists, thinkers and journalists which arose from a rare protest of several hundred people outside the culture ministry on Nov. 27. Both call for greater civil liberties and are the fresh face of the Cuban opposition in a country which is proud of its rich arts scene and where traditional political opposition groups have struggled to gain ground. ""State security rang us up to say they would not let anyone leave their homes during the congress, not even to put out the rubbish,"" 27N member and globally renowned performance artist Tania Bruguera told Reuters by telephone. ""They also cut internet for some of us."" Cuban authorities do not comment on police activity such as the detention of dissidents. Bruguera said she and other members of ""27N"" had been on and off prevented from leaving their homes and subjected to brief detentions and interrogations ever since the group's formation. State television has done programs on many attacking them. ""That Raul is retiring does not mean there will be change,"" said Bruguera who six years ago created an Institute of Artivisim in Havana, of the congress, which the party dubbed the ""congress of continuity"". ""Castro goes but Castrism stays"" read an editorial in the non-state online media outlet 14ymedio. The San Isidro Movement said one of their most prominent members Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara was detained overnight on Friday and his artworks seized from his home. He had been staging a performance in which he planned to sit in a garrote during the congress to denounce repression. Fellow MSI member and poet Amaury Pacheco told Reuters by phone he was also briefly detained when he tried to leave his house in protest at the seizure of Otero Alcantara's works. ""They don't want any raised voice or embarrassment during these four days,"" said Pacheco.

A Cuba Without a Castro? A Country Steps Into the Unknown.,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/americas/cuba-castro.html,04/19/21,www.nytimes.com,"Over the past few years, as the Trump administration imposed stringent sanctions on Cuba and the tourism industry was decimated by the pandemic, Cubans have seen their countrys economy plummet once again, with many waiting for hours in bread lines. The countrys lauded health care system is frayed. And the number of Cubans trying to leave the island is going up, though it is still far from the exoduses of the 1980s and 1990s. ""The Communist Party lives off the achievements of a long time ago, from when they began,"" said Claudia Genlui, an activist with the San Isidro political movement, a collective of artists who have protested against the Communist Party in recent months. Although the group is small, it has surprised the nation with its continued defiance. ""The party does not represent my generation, it does not represent me,"" Ms. Genlui said, adding that ""there is a lack of generational connection, of interests, of priorities, and all of that somehow drives us away."" Mr. Castro, to some extent, would agree. Although Fidel held fast to his rallying cry of ""socialism or death"" until he died in 2016, the younger Mr. Castro grew to realize that reform was necessary to quell growing discontent and began opening up the countrys economy. After Fidel formally resigned from the presidency in 2008, Raul Castro prioritized recruiting younger Cubans into the Communist Party and putting younger members into top government positions. On Monday, the party held elections for its 17-member Politburo, selecting younger members to the body to replace the last of what Cubans call the ""historics,"" veterans of the armed revolution. That has sat well with some Cubans. ""I think weve got to move on to a new generation, younger people with new ideas,"" said Osvaldo Reyes, 55, a taxi driver in Havana, while voicing his support for Mr. Castro and the Communist Party. ""A revolution should keep transforming, keep doing the best for people.""",
Raul Castro retires but Cuban Communist Party emphasizes continuity,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-president-diaz-canel-made-communist-party-leader-ending-castro-era-2021-04-19/,04/19/21,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA, April 19 (Reuters) - Cuba turned the page on the Castro era on Monday with the ruling Communist Party electing President Miguel Diaz-Canel to replace Raul Castro as party chief although he said he would continue to consult his predecessor on strategic decisions. The succession marks the end of six decades of rule by brothers Fidel and Raul Castro, who led a 1959 revolution in the Caribbean island nation of 11 million, installing a Communist-run country on the doorstep of the United States. The mantle now passes, in a carefully orchestrated transition, to a younger generation that worked its way up the party ranks rather than forging itself through guerrilla warfare. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Diaz-Canel, 60, who was party chief in two provinces before joining the national government in 2009, had already succeeded Castro, 89, as president in 2018, and been widely tipped to also take the role of first party secretary - the most powerful position in the country. His election came as part of a broader reshuffle of the party's political bureau at a four-day congress held largely behind closed doors under the banner of ""Unity and Continuity"". ""Comrade Raul ... will be consulted on the most important strategic decisions of greatest weight for the destiny of our nation. He will always be present,"" Diaz-Canel told hundreds of delegates in his first speech as party chief, his dark suit and red tie contrasting with Castro's military fatigues. Castro would also continue to dispense guidance and ""alerts in the face of any error or deficiency,"" he said. The reshuffle of the political bureau, the party's highest decision-making body in between sessions of the broader central committee, includes the appointment of Brigadier-General Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez-Calleja, head of the armed forces' enterprises which control swathes of the economy. The United States placed Lopez-Calleja, once married to Raul Castro's daughter Deborah, under sanctions late last year. Some Havana residents applauded the generational handover saying Diaz-Canel was more in tune with the times. Others were sceptical it would make much of a difference. ""The only thing that will happen is the Castros will go, but things will continue the same,"" said nurse Melanie Miranda, 22. WARNING SHOT Diaz-Canel has emphasized continuity since becoming president and is not expected to move Cuba away from its one-party socialist system, although he will be under pressure to undertake economic reforms. New U.S. sanctions and the pandemic have exacerbated the woes of Cuba's already ailing centrally planned economy, with widespread shortages of even basic goods spawning multi-hour lines outside stores across the country. Diaz-Canel said on Monday the economy had shown itself to be durable. Cuba had preserved social achievements - like universal healthcare and education - while showing solidarity with other countries during the pandemic, sending them doctors, he said. He also sent a warning shot to opposition activists, in the wake of a growing movement of dissident artists and journalists who have been staging provocative performances or small protests. Dissent has been strengthened by the rollout of the internet, giving Cubans more platforms to express their frustrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. Cuba calls the dissident artists part of a new onslaught of U.S.-backed soft coup attempts. They have denounced state security preventing them leaving their homes or cutting their internet and telephone lines during the congress to silence their voices. ""Those lumpen mercenaries who make money on the back of the destiny of all, those who call for invasion, those who continuously offend in words and acts ... would be well advised that this people's patience has limits,"" he said. NEW POLITBURO Castro said at the 2016 congress that it would be the last presided over by the so-called historic generation of those who fought in the Sierra Maestra to overthrow U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. The new policy-setting Political Bureau will not include Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, 90, and Ramiro Valdes, 88, two other famous members of that generation. The party did not replace Machado Ventura, a hardline communist ideologue, as deputy party leader. Valdes will remain a deputy prime minister. The only person from the historic generation to remain on the 14-member bureau is Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera, 77, who fought in the revolution as an adolescent. Cuban podcaster Camilo Condis criticized the committee for not representing the diversity of Cuba's increasingly heterogeneous society. ""There are no artists, who have had so much prominence in Cuban politics in recent months, and no self-employed Cubans who now represent more than 10% of the workforce and have few spaces to be listened to,"" he said. Cuba expert William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University, said the biggest challenge facing Cuba's new leaders now was economic. ""If the government and the party cannot get the economy growing, they will face real political peril,"" he said.

No problem: Yuliet Colon will help you whip up a dessert using the eggs you ran across, swap pork for the ground chicken in that recipe, even peanuts for beans in your Cuban-style rice. Shes among a number of Cubans who, with more ingenuity than resources, help their compatriots cope with shortages exacerbated by the new coronavirus pandemic with Facebook posts of culinary creations designed around what theyre actually likely to find at the market or with government rations. ADVERTISEMENT ""I love Master Chef Spain, but where do I get liquid nitrogen in this country?"" joked Colon, a 39-year-old mother of two and one of the creators of the Facebook page, ""Recipes from the Heart."" The site, launched in June, how has more than 12,000 members -- many of them on an island just becoming accustomed to social media due to recently improved internet access. The combination of COVID-19, which shut off income from tourism on the island, local economic productivity woes and sharpened U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump has led to increased scarcities in Cuba, where gross domestic product decreased by 11% in 2020. Long queues became noticeable last year, and 2021 opened with government economic reforms that effectively raised both prices and pay -- though not always at the same rate. Colon last week visited an agricultural market near her house and, after standing in lines for about 40 minutes, bought the few vegetables she found. She used them to create something that she called ""Cuban-style pisto manchego"" which includes onion, peppers, tomato, eggplant and cucumber -- winning admiring comments from other group members. These days, Cuban household staples come and go without warning. When toothpaste appears, deodorant disappears, and when it returns, soap and the toilet paper have vanished. The same is true for rice, beans, milk, cheese, onions, tomato and or garlic. Fruit has not been seen for weeks. Sometimes potato disappears, prompting Cubans to turn to other tubers popular in the region, yuca or rough-skinned malanga. The Facebook site has become a home for proposals on how to chicken when its the only meat available or create artisanal cheeses with others arent available. ""There are a lot of shortages"", lamented Colon in the small kitchen of her house while she prepared her ""pisto manchego,"" chopping the vegetables and photographing the process before uploading the images. ADVERTISEMENT She added a bit of fresh basil and oregano she took from a small flowerbed that a relative grows at the side of her house. ""What I like the most is making desserts, but now its hard to get eggs, milk or flour,"" Colon said. The Facebook page is an internet-era democratization of earlier efforts to help Cubans make due in hard times, notably following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which devastated the economy of its Caribbean ally in the early 1990s. A TV cooking show at that time once offered suggestions for cooking grapefruit rind steaks. Thanks to arrival of internet access, services to manage food or deliver merchandise have proliferated and relatives abroad can even directly pay telephone bills for those on the island. Cubans can share tips on WhatsApp or Twitter about which stores are stocked with which products. Theyve also helped make authorities more accountable in some cases -- as when a state factory distributed croquettes that cooks complained seemed to explode when put in oil and authorities responded with explanations in the local press. Colon relies on the internet to communicate with her mother, whose deposits help pay for web access that keeps her on Facebook. Colon usually adds a few family anecdotes in her posts. ""The kitchen is my happy place, where I am calmer and I feel better,"" she said.",
Cuba's Raul Castro confirms he's stepping down as head of Communist Party,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-raul-castro-confirms-stepping-head-communist-party-rcna689,04/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"Raul Castro confirmed Friday he is stepping down as the head of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most powerful position on the island. During a speech on the first day of the Communist Party's eighth congress, he said he would hand over power to a younger generation that is ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit."" ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live, I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told party delegates at the closed-door meeting at a convention center in Havana. He was retiring, Castro said, with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland."" Though there are few expectations of significant change among Cubans, it is however a historic move -- Castro and his late brother, Fidel Castro, have been in power since the 1959 revolution. Though Castro did not name his successor during the speech, it's expected that a subsequent vote will ratify President Miguel Diaz-Canel as the next party secretary-general and set policy guidelines. Raul Castro had said in 2018 he expected Diaz-Canel to replace him after his retirement in 2021. Diaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president. Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death. In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this years congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion. Castros retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families. The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials. The countrys challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe. President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administrations harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they wont be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the ""political moment"" has changed from the Obama administration years and that ""oppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years."" Disenchantment in the island over the countrys centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Partys congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented. Fidel Castro and Raul Castro wave during the annual May Day parade in Revolution Plaza in Havana, May 1, 1973. Cristoval Pascual / AP Victoria Hernandez 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress. ""I think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what were thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,"" she said. Need for economic reform But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society. Arturo Lopez-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control. ""What is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,"" he said. ""Now they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance."" He said there arent high expectations among Cubans because the country ""will remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party."" Fabio Fernandez, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says its important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system. ""A new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,"" he said. Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Sanchez ended up in a detention center facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) MIAMI (AP) -- After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba. Since the end of the Obama administration, the number of Cubans deported from the U.S. has increased more than tenfold to more than 800 in the past year as the Trump administration enforces a new policy inked just days before it took over. It is also imposing its own sharp limits on who is eligible for asylum. Thats an unwelcome development for growing numbers of asylum-seeking Cubans who had long benefited from a generous U.S. approach and their governments unwillingness to take its people back. ADVERTISEMENT For decades, Cubans fleeing the communist-governed island had for the most part enjoyed unique privileges. Even after the cold war ended, they were given a certain path to legal residence once they touched U.S. soil through the policy known as ""wet foot, dry foot."" But an agreement reached during the final days of the Obama administration ended that and required Cuba to take back citizens who receive deportation orders going forward and consider on a case-by-case basis the return of the thousands of other Cubans who had received such orders over the decades but remained in the U.S. because their country wouldnt take them back. Since Trump took office, more Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border have encountered new limits, including a policy introduced last month that denies protection to asylum seekers who have passed through another country before reaching Mexico and have not sought asylum there. Despite the new agreement, Cuba remains reluctant to take its people back, and is one of 10 countries that the U.S. government labels ""recalcitrant."" That makes it difficult for the administration to enforce its aggressive measures against asylum -- and leaves many Cubans in limbo. Many, like Sanchez, are baffled by their predicament. Sanchez is married to Barbara Rodriguez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Miami, but was unable to apply for a visa in Cuba to join his wife in the U.S. because the Trump administration pulled most of its embassy staff out, outsourcing family-related visa petitions to consular services in Colombia or Guyana. Rodriguez claims Sanchez was facing increasing political persecution after having brushes with local authorities over such episodes as damaging a referendum ballot as a sign of protest. ADVERTISEMENT The couple agreed he had to get out of Cuba, saying they had learned he was being investigated and could face jail time. Feeling they had no time to waste -- and with no visa services available in Cuba -- Sanchez traveled to Nicaragua and through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S., at a port of entry where authorities detained him and later sent him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for long-term custody. ""This is plain cruel, despite arriving in this country and demonstrating that you are persecuted and that you have credible fear. After all, this gets thrown away,"" said his wife, Rodriguez, who talks to Sanchez on the phone daily. ""The worse thing is that now I feel all that is left for him is deportation."" It is unclear how the Cuban government treats people who are deported from the U.S., but rights advocates and lawyers say they could face retaliation for claiming asylum, especially those who claimed they were being persecuted. By contrast, deportees to Mexico and Central American countries typically get a warm welcome home. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told The Associated Press the increase in deportations stems from the country ""diligently fulfilling its commitments"" outlined in the accord with the Obama administration, but at the same time he blasted the U.S. for cutting consular services in Havana. ""It is a shame to politicize the human bond between people and between nations,"" he said. A chartered U.S. government flight landed in Havana on Sept. 27 with 96 Cubans aboard, and another with 120 arrived Aug. 30. U.S. officials say Cubas acceptance of this limited number of deportees is a small step, but they believe the nation is still largely unwilling to work with the U.S. on repatriations. They note 39,243 Cubans living in the U.S. with deportation orders. ""Cuba is kind of a thorn in their side in this area,"" said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Cuba remains on a U.S. government list of ""recalcitrant"" nations with nine other countries: China, Vietnam, Iran, Bhutan, Cambodia, Eritrea, Hong Kong, Laos and Pakistan. About 21,000 Cubans have presented themselves to officials at U.S.-Mexico crossings since last October, triple the number seen the previous 12 months, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics. Thousands more Cubans have been stranded in northern Mexico cities on wait lists to request asylum and through a program that forces migrants to wait south of the border for their asylum cases to play out. Of the Cubans who have been allowed into the U.S., many have been released from custody while they await court dates for their asylum cases, but hundreds have been turned over to ICE custody. About 5,000 Cubans have received deportation orders since the new U.S.-Cuba agreement, and 1,300 of them have been deported, according to ICE data. Luis Dayan Palmero left Cuba in April, traveling from Guyana to Brazil and Colombia, before passing through Central America and arriving in northern Mexico in August. He crossed the Rio Grande and surrendered to Border Patrol agents, who sent him to Matamoros, Mexico. He now has a U.S. court appearing set this month. ""I plan to ask for asylum, and whatever happens is what God wants,"" Palmero said. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this story from Havana.",

(U.S. State Department via AP) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Wednesday accused the top U.S. diplomat in the country of working closely with Jose Daniel Ferrer, the detained head of one of the countrys largest opposition groups. The accusations against charge daffaires Mara Tekach were a break from Cubas normal language on U.S. relations, which had remained measured despite an escalating Trump administration campaign to cut off revenue and oil to Cuba. Tekach and the U.S. Embassy in Cuba have tried to foment division among Cubans, ""identifying areas of the economy where they can direct coercive measures, and trying to slander and discredit the performance of the Cuban government and Cuban revolution,"" a Cuban government statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Cuba reopened in 2015 during President Barack Obamas normalization of relations with the island. It has been operating with a skeleton staff since the withdrawal of most personnel in 2017 due to concerns about mysterious health symptoms whose cause has still not been publicly determined. ADVERTISEMENT Ferrer was detained last month on charges that remained unclear until this week. The U.S., opposition groups and human rights organizations demanded his release. Ferrers supporters said that he had been charged with assault and called the case a fabrication. The statement Wednesday in Granma, the Communist Partys official newspaper, said Ferrer was detained Oct. 1 with three other people on suspicion of kidnapping and assaulting another man. It alleged that, since the detention, the United States has used the case in a campaign to discredit Cuba. ""The United States Embassy in Cuba has been the fundamental vehicle for attending to, orienting and financing the conduct of Jose Daniel Ferrer, in a clear demonstration of interference in Cubas internal affairs and open instigation of violence,"" the Cuban statement said. The U.S. says Ferrer is a peaceful dissident whose human rights have been regularly violated by Cuban security forces. Ferrers Patriotic Union of Cuba is perhaps the countrys largest opposition group, with operations based mainly in the east of the island. It sporadically organizes protests against the government, which calls its members mercenaries backed by the U.S. and Cuban exiles overseas.",

The current Trump U.S. administration is close to announcing a new policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama, according to a Trump administration official and a person involved in the ongoing policy review. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) HAVANA (AP) -- President Barack Obamas 2014 opening with Cuba helped funnel American travel dollars into military-linked tourism conglomerates even as state security agents waged a fierce crackdown on dissent. The rapprochement also poured hundreds of millions in U.S. spending into privately owned businesses on the island, supercharging the growth of an entrepreneurial middle-class independent of the communist state. It opened a new market for American corporations, with JetBlue and American Airlines operating from gleaming new Havana offices and tens of thousands of private bed-and-breakfasts listed on Airbnb. ADVERTISEMENT Internet access became an affordable reality for hundreds of thousands of Cubans as President Raul Castro met a pledge to Obama and opened nearly 400 public Wi-Fi access points across the country. Meanwhile, longtime enemies separated by 90 miles of ocean struck agreements to cooperate on issues ranging from human trafficking to oil spills. This is the complex scenario facing President Donald Trump as Cuban-American legislators and lobbyists pressure him to fulfill his campaign promise to undo Obamas deal with Cuba. The administration is close to announcing a new policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama, according to a Trump administration official and a person involved in the ongoing policy review. ""As the President has said, the current Cuba policy is a bad deal. It does not do enough to support human rights in Cuba,"" White House spokesman Michael Short said. ""We anticipate an announcement in the coming weeks."" Still under debate: new restrictions on American leisure travel to Cuba, which has more than tripled since Obamas announcement, to nearly 300,000 last year. Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans hate the idea of U.S. travelers enjoying mojitos in the police state that drove exiles from their homes and businesses. Tourism to Cuba remains barred by U.S. law, and American travelers to Cuba still must fall into one of 12 categories of justification for their travel, ranging from religious to educational activities meant to bring the traveler into contact with Cuban people. When Obama took office, ""people-to-people"" travelers could only see the country as part of organized tours -- a measure meant to guarantee that Americans experienced only educational activities such as visits to printing workshops or organic farmers markets. ADVERTISEMENT In reality, the tour requirement guaranteed that American travelers spent virtually every second of their time in Cuba under the direct control of the government, which requires U.S. tour operators to use government tour buses and guides and stay almost entirely in state-run hotels. As his second term came to a close, Obama eliminated that requirement and opened the door for tens of thousands of travelers to book their own independent trips to Cuba. Opponents of Obamas rollback say that has allowed many to engage in prohibited tourism, spending leisure days at the beach and all-inclusive resorts. But individual travel has also served as rocket fuel for Cubas burgeoning private sector. Tens of thousands of Americans are booking direct flights on U.S. airlines to Havana, reserving private lodging through Airbnb and spending thousands of dollars on private guides, taxis and restaurants. A former industrial engineer, 31-year-old Adyarin Ruiz runs a four-bedroom bed-and-breakfast in a restored section of Old Havana thats seeing an increasing number of Americans willing to pay up to $100 a night in a country where state salaries average $25 a month. ""Over the last two years, since relations with the U.S. were restored, Ive seen the growth in American tourism, and even more so since the direct flights started,"" Ruiz said. ""The Americans whove come here are VIPS. You can see that they have money and they appreciate and demand quality, and demand that the house looks really pretty."" There are also now U.S. jobs dependent on travel to Cuba. The American pro-detente group Engage Cuba released a study Thursday asserting that a complete rollback of Obamas Cuba policy would cost airlines and cruise lines $3.5 billion over the next four years and lead to the loss of 10,154 travel jobs. Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss ongoing policy talks say domestic political concerns are the main force driving any rollback on Cuba. During the transition, Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson privately expressed support for Obamas Cuba policy, U.S. officials from the former and current administrations told The Associated Press. The main people still seeking a reversal in the opening are Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, both Cuban-Americans. The Trump government wants to maintain good relations with both Rubio, who sits on the Senate committee investigating Trumps relations with Russia, and Diaz-Balart, a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. Some top Trump advisers also believe that a 2020 re-election victory will rest on keeping the loyalty of Cuban-Americans in Florida whom they see as essential to winning the critical swing state. Many object to the Cuban government seeing any benefit from relations with the U.S., opposed to thousands of American travelers staying in hotels run by GAESA, an increasingly powerful business conglomerate with deep military ties. Cuban-Americans have been particularly offended by Obama allowing U.S. companies to deal directly with military-linked companies, most prominently in an agreement for Stamford, Connecticut-based Starwood to manage at least two Havana hotels. Anti-Castro forces have also been demanding action on human rights: arrests and short-term detentions of protesters climbed from 8,899 in 2014 to 9,940 last year. Cuban officials say many of those arrests are deliberately provoked by dissidents who are funded and backed by anti-Castro groups with the deliberate objective of driving up detention statistics. But the officials say theres another reason to tighten Americas Cuba policy: pressuring Venezuela. The Trump administration has been looking for ways to force Venezuela to address the near-daily protests and violence trying to shake President Nicolas Maduros iron grip on power. Cuba is Maduros close ally and supporter and measures against the Cuban military would send at least the appearance that the U.S. is taking action. Meanwhile, Cuba is preparing for its own transition. Castro is planning to leave Cubas presidency in February 2018 and is expected to hand the role to a 57-year-old vice president who has said little about his vision for the country. Rubios office described the senators goals as laying the groundwork for a new generation of Cuban leaders to empower ordinary citizens of the island. ""I am confident the President will keep his commitment on Cuba policy by making changes that are targeted and strategic and which advance the Cuban peoples aspirations for economic and political liberty,"" Rubio said in a statement released by his office Thursday. _________ Weissenstein reported from Havana and Miami.

Feature: Massive caravan riders across Cuba protest against U.S. embargo - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/northamerica/2021-04/26/c_139907222.htm,04/26/21,www.xinhuanet.com,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-04-26 14:30:40|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- With massive car and bicycle caravans across the country, and a regatta along the capital of Havana's seaside Malecon, Cubans demanded on Sunday the lifting of a six-decade-old U.S. embargo against the island, known as blockade among locals. In Santa Clara, located some 270 km east of Havana, hundreds of masked drivers, cyclists and bikers also gathered to make their way through the city. ""It is a clear demonstration the Cuban people support the socialist revolution and that the U.S. blockade against the country must end,"" Santa Clara resident Diamela Lopez told Xinhua. ""The U.S. administration has sanctioned many foreign companies for trading with Cuba,"" he added. Chanting patriotic slogans, blaring horns, and holding national flags, the participants finally reached the Che Guevara Mausoleum in the city. Leonardo Fernandez, a 25-year-old medical student from Santa Clara, said that the U.S. embargo continues to harm the living standards of the Cuban people. ""The blockade has hindered Cuba's access to medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he told Xinhua. ""The U.S. unilateral policy towards the island affects our health system, our public transport network, and the society as a whole."" Meanwhile, hundreds of people also participated in car and bicycle caravans against the embargo in Cuban cities, including Las Tunas, Baracoa, and Nueva Gerona. In addition, some 40 yachts took part in an international regatta that navigated along Havana's coastline while locals flooded social media with pictures taken from balconies and rooftops. It is part of a world initiative in solidarity with the Cuban people, which has taken place over the weekend in more than 50 countries, according to organizers. Earlier this week, Diosvany Acosta, first secretary of Cuba's Young Communist League, said that all voices and energies must be made to stand up against the U.S. embargo. ""The consequences of the U.S. blockade affect all of us, and before such a crime we must not remain in silence,"" he said on social media. The Cuban government announced that it would present its annual draft resolution against the embargo before the UN General Assembly on June 23, which was postponed last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. First imposed in 1962, the embargo was intensified by former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which banned U.S. flights to Cuban cities except for Havana, barred U.S. cruise ships and yachts from visiting the Caribbean nation, and limited remittances that Cuban-Americans sent to their families on the island.

'Tear down this firewall' - US looks to expand Cuba internet,https://apnews.com/33d21df8f7de4d34b3fd0b26659b9ea8/'Tear-down-this-firewall'---US-looks-to-expand-Cuba-internet,04/29/21,apnews.com,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new U.S. task force ordered by President Donald Trump warned Wednesday that Cubas government uses internet restrictions to stifle dissent and vowed to find ways the United States could expand access and freedom for Cubans online. The Cuba Internet Task Force held its first public meeting over the objections of Cuban President Raul Castros government, which has dismissed it as an exercise in attempted subversion by Washington. The task force forms part of Trumps tougher approach to Cuba and partial rollback of former President Barack Obamas diplomatic opening with the island. ADVERTISEMENT ""Mr. Castro, tear down this firewall,"" declared Andre Mendes, acting director of the Broadcasting Board of Governors Office of Cuba Broadcasting, in a high-tech twist on former President Ronald Reagans famed admonition to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Although the task forces narrow mandate is to develop recommendations for how the U.S. could expand internet access in Cuba, the meeting quickly took on clear political undertones, ever-present in Americas long and emotional debate about its policy toward the communist-run island 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Florida. Under fluorescent lighting in a sparse, basement conference room at the State Department, several Cuban dissidents used a public comment period to lambast Cubas government, drawing comparisons to World War II and to the governments of Syria and Iran. Yet most of the public comments centered on a critique of a decades-old economic embargo and Trumps policy toward Cuba. Some argued that any U.S. efforts would backfire, by undermining the perceived independence and credibility of burgeoning independent media in Cuba. Created under a directive from Trump last June, the task force includes senior officials from the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Agency for International Development. It has no budget, but set a goal to deliver its report on recommendations to Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by February 2019. John Creamer, the deputy assistant secretary of state, said estimates show internet penetration in Cuba is between 5 percent and 40 percent, with the higher figure including those who only can access government-run internet. He said the $1 per hour cost for wi-fi is onerous considering the average salary of roughly $30 per month. For internet access at home, Cubans must pay $17 to $80 per month, depending on speed, for only 30 hours of connectivity, Creamer said. ADVERTISEMENT He said Cubas government ""filters and blocks websites"" in a bid to impede the Cuban peoples ability to criticize government institutions and policies. ""Such acts of aggression have a chilling effect on the exercise of the fundamental freedom of expression,"" Creamer said. Internet access in Cuba, once rare and prohibitively expensive, has spread dramatically and dropped in price since Obama and Castros 2014 deal to normalize relations. There are 508 public WiFi access points across the country and Cuba has begun providing home internet access in cities across the country. The government also says it will begin offering mobile internet access this year. The Cuban internet is mostly uncensored. The state does block some sites, particularly those that receive U.S. funding such as the Office of Cuba Broadcastings Marti television network, but those sites channels can be freely accessed through third parties like Facebook and YouTube. Some of the likely recommendations for expanding access are technical. Tom Sullivan, chief of the FCCs international bureau, said there are no direct, undersea cables between the U.S. and Cuba, though he said there appear to be some U.S. satellites providing service in the island. There was no immediate reaction to the meeting from the Cuban Embassy. But ahead of the meeting, Cuba protested the task forces creation through diplomatic notes rejecting ""the goal of manipulating the internet to bring about illegal programs with subversive political ends."" Cubas Foreign Ministry said it ""reiterated the Cuban governments determination to not tolerate any type of subversive activity or interference in its internal affairs."" ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP",
Cuba could be closing in on COVID vaccine sovereignty,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/29/cuba-is-closing-in-on-covid-19-vaccine-sovereignty,04/29/21,www.aljazeera.com,"The island is developing five experimental shots but two have reached final-stage trials. With two domestically produced COVID-19 vaccines in stage-three clinical trials, Cuba is racing towards potentially becoming the first country in Latin America to develop its own shot against the coronavirus. The island of 11 million people, which has been under a strict US trade embargo for decades, is in process of developing five experimental shots, including Soberana 02 and Abdala, which reached final-stage trials last month. The names of the vaccines reveal much about how Cuba sees the national effort. Soberana translates as ""sovereign"", while the Abdala shot was named after a patriotic poem by the Cuban revolutionary hero Jose Marti. Around 44,000 people will receive the Soberana 02 vaccine, and some 48,000 volunteers have been recruited for the Abdala trial. According to local reports, an additional 150,000 frontline workers will also receive the Soberana 02 shot. The Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, which is developing Abdala, is hoping to have ""effective results"" from the trial by early June, while results from the trial of Soberana 02, which is being developed by the Finlay Institute, are expected in May. ""There are already positive preliminary results,"" Ricardo Perez, head of International Relations at the Finlay Vaccine Institute, told Al Jazeera. ""These might allow us to present a dossier to the Cuban authorities that would enable us to request approval for emergency use of the product, not anymore as a candidate but as a product ... probably by the end of next month,"" he said. Health workers are tested after receiving a dose of the Soberana-02 COVID-19 vaccine, as part of stage-three trials of the experimental Cuban vaccine candidate [File: Ramon Espinosa /Reuters] Dr Gerardo Guillen, Director of Biomedical Research at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, told Al Jazeera that there were high levels of trust among the public in the candidate vaccines. ""Since health is universal and free and the centres do not profit from access to these vaccines, these conditions remove many ethical barriers and create a lot of trust in the centres for research and vaccine production,"" he said. Cuba is hoping to vaccinate all its inhabitants before the end of the year. The Finlay Institute says it can produce 100 million doses of the Soberana 02 vaccine this year. The aim is to satisfy the countrys demand and to be able to export the remaining shots. It is an ambitious goal, but the countrys pharmaceutical and biotech industries have a decades-long history and have produced several vaccines including shots against Hepatitis B and Meningitis B. ""Cuba has been developing vaccines since the 80s, so despite having a poor and dysfunctional economy, the government managed to develop an important technological platform for a small country,"" Cuba economist Ricardo Torres told Al Jazeera. Dr Jose Moya, a representative of the Pan American Health Organization in Cuba, said the island already develops 80 percent of the vaccines that are part of its national immunisation programme. ""Cuba has the capacity to do this,"" Dr Moya told Al Jazeera. ""This is also important for the region since this could [also] open the opportunity to transfer technology within our countries,"" Dr Moya said. A health worker asks questions in a quarantine area amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in Havana, Cuba [File: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] The race to develop vaccines comes as the island struggles with a recent surge of infections. The seven-day average for new infections was more than 1,100 on April 28, according to Our World in Data. Cubas death toll since the pandemic started has reached 614. For much of last year, the country saw extremely low rates of new infections. The spike followed after the government opened borders to international travel in November. However, the number of infections and deaths remains much lower in Cuba than in other parts of the world, where new variants have overwhelmed health systems in several countries. The government did not purchase vaccines from other countries and Cuba did not sign up to the COVAX scheme, a vaccine-sharing initiative backed by the World Health Organization, and developed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi. The government has not commented on the decision to rely on domestic vaccine production. Dr Guillen noted that some countries have experienced problems with vaccine supply chains, and said the US embargo on Cuba made it harder to access some materials. ""Some countries that have already signed contracts have not been able to access the doses they have [bought], due to the lack of availability in vaccines,"" Dr Guillen said. ""In Cuba, the access is more difficult due to the embargo. Therefore we have to rely on our own capabilities and strengths, and that is what weve been doing,"" he added. Cuba is currently struggling with a rise in cases with an average of more than1,100 daily cases [File:Ramon Espinosa/Reuters] The US embargo against Cuba is one of the longest trade embargoes in modern history. Starting in the late 1950s, the embargo prohibits most US companies and individuals from doing business in Cuba. Under the embargo, businesses are not allowed to sell to Cuba any medical product that contains more than 20 percent of American components, and the regulations require an individual license for equipment that has more than 10 percent. During the presidency of Donald Trump, 90 new economic restrictions were imposed in Cuba. These targeted financial transactions, tourism, energy, and foreign investments. The blockade has made it difficult to acquire the raw materials needed to produce the vaccines and to make payments to Cubas international suppliers, Dr Guillen said.

""We try to acquire products that dont have the American technology, but sometimes that is very difficult, so then we have to do it through third countries, and many times those countries are also blocked ... the technology for Cuba is blocked,"" he added. However, as the vaccine trials have progressed, the government has talked about sending doses to countries including Venezuela and Iran, where Soberana 02 is also undergoing late-stage trials. Earlier this month Venezuela announced the signing of an agreement with Cuba that would allow them to produce the Abdala vaccine. ""The priority until now has been to develop a vaccine for [Cubas] population,"" Dr Guillen said. ""Cuba has always been open to South-South cooperation, however, our capacity of production is not unlimited, so we will have to discuss with our counterparts, [and find] different ways to address this,"" he added.",

Feature: Cuba sends peace message against U.S. embargo - Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/northamerica/2021-05/31/c_139980397.htm,05/31/21,www.xinhuanet.com,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-05-31 11:05:46|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- With a symbolic release of about 6,000 pigeons all over the country, the Cubans on Sunday condemned the six-decade U.S. embargo against the island, known as the blockade among locals. In Havana, participants gathered at the National Hotel's gardens, where Cuban flags and patriotic banners in support of the socialist revolution were placed. The event was attended by representatives of the island's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cuban Pigeon Fanciers Federation, and the country's social organizations. ""People who love Cuba stand against the U.S. blockade,"" Andres Carvajal, president of the students' league at the Technological University of Havana, told Xinhua. ""We are sending a peace message,"" he added. The event came as the island nation registered 1,079 new COVID-19 infections and seven related deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the national caseload to 141,166 and death toll to 950. Fermin Quinones, president of the Cuban Association of the United Nations (ACNU), told Xinhua that the U.S. embargo continued to affect the social and economic development of the Caribbean nation. ""It is part of a global initiative in solidarity with the Cuban people, which has taken place in more than 70 countries over the weekend,"" he said. ""We want to raise awareness about the necessity to put an end to the U.S. blockade on Cuba."" Meanwhile, hundreds of people also participated in a car and bicycle caravan against the embargo in the central province of Ciego de Avila. In addition, some 50 yachts took part in a regatta that navigated along the southern Cuban city of Cienfuegos's sea boulevard as dozens of masked people waved from the shore. On June 23, the Cuban government will present its annual draft resolution against the embargo before the UN General Assembly, which was postponed last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a morning tweet, Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez said: ""As the world demands to build bridges of love amid the pandemic, the U.S. government keeps Donald Trump's measures that affect the Cuban people intact."" ""The fight against the COVID-19 (pandemic) is universal, so is the claim against the blockade,"" he added. First imposed in 1962, the U.S. embargo on Cuba was reinforced by former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which adopted more than 240 economic measures against the island. Those measures include banning U.S. flights to Cuban cities except Havana, barring U.S. cruise ships and yachts from visiting the Caribbean nation, and limiting remittances that Cuban Americans send to their families on the island.

Cuban Dissidents Plan 'Transition and Reconstruction' After Communism,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/06/04/cuban-dissidents-plan-transition-and-reconstruction-after-communism/,06/04/21,www.breitbart.com,"A coalition of over 20 dissident organizations spanning 11 provinces in Cuba recently held a ""Congress of the Cuban Nation"" to address not just the eradication of communism, but the republic that should replace it, the Assembly for the Cuban Resistance confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance is a coalition of pro-democracy, human rights groups both on the island and in the diaspora, many of which participated in the Congress of the Cuban Nation. Many of its member groups participated in the discussions. The events - 63 different meetings addressing topics from the reunification of the island population with the Cuban diaspora to the creation of ""joint commissions for the transition and reconstruction"" of the country following 62 years of communism - took place last week. They served as a vision of what a Congress representing all facets of a nation should be, the dissidents contended, in contrast to the Eighth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party, taking place this week. The Communist Party is the only legal party in Cuba and, under the rule of the Castro dictators, has remained in power since President Fulgencio Batista fled the country in 1959. Prior to that date, Cuba functioned as a republic since its founding in 1902. The Party dictates all priorities and investments of the Cuban government and controls the nations entire economy, profiting the most from control of the nations lucrative tourism industry and its slave-doctor network, which the Organization of American States (OAS) has declared a form of human trafficking. Tensions among the general population in Cuba have escalated in the past year as the island has experienced a particularly severe outbreak of Chinese coronavirus after the Communist Party initially welcomed tourists while the rest of the world shut down. Italian tourists were the first people to test positive for Chinese coronavirus on the island, according to government statistics. Exacerbating the problem are densely-populated food ration lines and the use of poorly administered prison camps to isolate suspected coronavirus patients. The Congress of the Cuban Nation differed from prior dissident events in that it attempted to shift the focus of the pro-democracy community away from solely opposing the dictatorship in power and towards solving the mounting list of problems the Cuban people face - proving the Cuban people can govern themselves. The movement towards illicitly exercising the right to self-governance under communism, in addition to protesting the region, is the start of a shift towards liberation events planned for the 120th anniversary of the Republic of Cuba in 2022, according to Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the director of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance. The Congress also served to shift the movement towards a leaderless, more open structure making it more difficult for the Cuban state to imprison, torture, and silence dissidents, emulating a greater shift towards leaderless anti-authoritarian movements in other communist areas like Belarus and Hong Kong. Many of those in attendance at the dissident Congress also participated in nationwide protests in April calling for the freedom of 47 pro-democracy dissidents in Hong Kong, currently held under charges of violating Chinas illegitimate ""national security"" law. Under the ""one country, two systems"" policy, Beijing has no power to implement laws in Hong Kong, and Hong Kongs detention of dissidents under the national security law is itself illegal. Among the issues on the agenda for the dissident Congress were the longtime repression of labor unions on the island - despite the Communist Party claiming to represent workers; violence against women, of which the state is a significant perpetrator; and a ""national strike"" to paralyze the Communist Party, a form of protest seen more often in Latin America undertaken by leftist labor groups. ""The different sectors active in the Congress made the decision that the only way to achieve social revindication and respect for human rights is taking to the streets to demand them civically,"" documents distributed to all cells of the Congress read in part, urging members to ""work tirelessly to achieve unity among the forces of the resistance organized by parties, movements, unions, professionals, and independent activists throughout the nation."" The documents featured photos of the events and displayed both the flag of the Republic of Cuba and the first flag ever used, in 1868, to represent Cuba as a sovereign nation, at the start of the war of independence against Spain. The ultimate goal, the documents clarified, is the creation of ""a new republic - [to] create a roadmap for transition and reconstruction of the country in all sectors."" The group concluded that its next steps would be the creation of ""joint commissions for the transition and reconstruction [post-communism], based on existing reconstruction proposals within and without Cuba.""

""Only now, they weren't limited to the capital; they didn't even start there, it seems,"" he said. Sunday's demonstrations broke out at around midday in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana.

A combination of sanctions, inefficiencies and the pandemic has shut down tourism and slowed other foreign revenue flows in a country dependent on them to import the bulk of its food, fuel and inputs for agriculture and manufacturing. The economy contracted 10.9% last year, and 2% through June of 2021. The resulting cash crunch has spawned shortages that have forced Cubans to queue for hours for basic goods throughout the pandemic. Cuba has begun a mass vaccination campaign, with 1.7 million of its 11.2 million residents vaccinated to date and twice that many have received at least one shot in the three-shot process. Still, the arrival of the Delta variant has prompted cases to surge, with health authorities reporting a record 6,923 cases and 47 deaths on Sunday - twice as many as the previous week.

Cubans take to streets in rare protests over lack of freedoms and worsening economy,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/americas/cuba-protests/index.html,07/11/21,www.cnn.com,"Havana, Cuba (CNN) Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. Demonstrators complained about a lack of freedom and the worsening economic situation during the rare protests, according to people who spoke to CNN and videos from multiple cities, including capital Havana. Many chanted for ""freedom"" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down. Multiple protesters were arrested by police, who used tear gas to break up some demonstrations. In Havana, a CNN team witnessed demonstrators being forcibly arrested and thrown into the back of vans by police officers. There were also violent clashes, where protesters turned over a police car and threw rocks at officers. In a nationally televised address, President Diaz-Canel said US trade sanctions had created economic misery on the communist-run island. Diaz-Canel did not offer the protesters any concessions in his speech, but instead urged his supporters to physically confront them. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance, ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets."" In the city of San Antonio de los Banos, just outside Havana province, hundreds of people defied a heavy police presence to air their complaints. One resident who did not wish to be identified told CNN that residents had been enduring power outages for a week and that had ""detonated"" the growing outrage. Social media platforms are being restricted in Cuba, according to internet monitor NetBlocks. NetBlocks tweeted on Monday that ""Social media and messaging platforms restricted in #Cuba from Monday on state-run internet provider ETECSA; real-time network data corroborate reports of internet disruptions amid widening anti-government protests; incident ongoing #CubaSOS."" The NetBlocks website said its metrics showed that WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and some Telegram servers were being disrupted. Videos uploaded to social media showed how the spontaneous protest movement has gained momentum, with streams appearing of other protests in a handful of cities and towns across the island. In some of the videos, people shouted they ""weren't afraid"" or that they wanted liberty or access to coronavirus vaccines. President Diaz-Canel made an unplanned stop in San Antonio de los Banos on Sunday after police had cleared protesters, while Cuban government officials blamed the protests on ""salaried agents"" on Twitter. Calls for restraint On Monday, US President Joe Biden called on the Diaz-Canel government to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also tweeted on Sunday night, ""the U.S. supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights."" Other US officials also urged for restraint, saying Cubans had the right to protest. ""We are deeply concerned by ""calls to combat"" in #Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people's right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence,"" Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted Sunday. ""For decades, Cuba's dictatorship has used violence and repression to silence its people, rather than permit the free exercise of democracy and their basic social rights,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez said in a statement. ""This must end. The world's eyes are on Cuba tonight and the dictatorship must understand we will not tolerate the use of brute force to silence the aspirations of the Cuban people,"" he added. Other world leaders have also weighed in, with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro criticizing socialist regimes on the continent. People went on the streets to ask for ""freedom,"" and received ""rubber bullets, beatings, and prison,"" he said. Strained US-Cuba relations But statements from US leaders have prompted angry criticism from Cuban authorities, who argue that US sanctions are the cause of Cuba's ailing economy. US-Cuban relations are at their lowest point in years. The Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, and so far, the Biden administration seems reluctant to lift them The already struggling Cuban economy has been hit hard as tourism and good imports have dropped steeply during the pandemic. On Sunday, Cuban health officials reported a record single-day increase for new Covid-19 cases and deaths President Diaz-Canel criticized the protests, calling demonstrators vandals who ""broke into the stores and stole [many] items."" He pointed to ""restrictive measures"" by the Trump administration that caused ""a very rough period of time, where we were going to have many difficulties and economic scarcities."" Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez also criticized Sullivan's statement on Monday, saying he had ""no political or moral authority to speak about Cuba."" ""His government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to promote subversion in our country & implements a genocidal blockade, which is the main cause of economic scarcities,"" Rodriguez added in a tweet. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also called on the US to suspend their Cuba trade embargo as a humanitarian gesture. ""No country in the world should be fenced in, blockaded -- that's the opposite of human rights,"" he said. When asked why Biden had not yet reversed Trump's policies towards Cuba, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the US had continued to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies -- but added, ""I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy."" In a statement on Sunday, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken pushed back against criticisms from the Cuban government, saying ""it would be a grievous mistake for the Cuban regime to interpret what is happening in dozens of towns and cities across the island as the result or product of anything the United States has done."" ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" he said.",

Fueled in recent years by the cowardly Colin Kaepernick, preference for communist ideals and redefining American symbols as representations of ""white supremacy"" continues to only grow in popularity among media figures looking to benefit off the dangerous rhetoric -- while citizens under the dictatorship rule continue to be tortured, killed and starved by their government.

""Not only that, Kaepernick then played against the Miami Dolphins and defended, because he was asked about it by a lot of Latin American former refugees from Cuba, all over Venezuela, who have seen the hard hand of socialism face to face, he was asked about it ... and he praised Cuba!

He was re-elected president on 24 February 2013. Shortly thereafter, Raul Castro announced that his second term would be his final term, and that he would not seek re-election in 2018. He stepped down from the presidency on 19 April 2018 after his successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel was elected by the National Assembly following parliamentary elections. Raul Castro remained the first secretary of the Communist Party; he was still considered the de facto leader of the country, retaining oversight over the president. Raul Castro announced at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, which began on 16 April 2021, that he was retiring. His successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel, was voted in on 19 April. Raul Castro, the younger brother of the iconic Fidel Castro always stayed in the shadows of his brother and never held much charm in public narrative.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, present during the vote in the General Assembly Hall, said that the blockade was a ""massive, flagrant and unacceptable violation of the human rights of the Cuban people"". He added that the embargo is about ""an economic war of extraterritorial scope against a small country already affected in the recent period by the economic crisis derived from the pandemic"". Mr. Rodriguez estimated 2020 losses to be $9.1 million. The diplomat said that the sanctions have made it harder for his country to acquire the medical equipment needed to develop COVID-19 vaccines as well as equipment for food production.

Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the unrest on old Cold War foe the United States, which in recent years tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island, in a televised speech on Sunday afternoon. Diaz-Canel said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by US-orchestrated social media campaigns and ""mercenaries"" on the ground, and warned that further ""provocations"" would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront ""provocations."" People screamed, ""We are not frightened!"" as they marched through the streets on Sunday, according to videos posted on social media. ""Freedom! Freedom!"" shouts the crowd. Analysts believe the protests are uncommon in a country where dissidents are closely monitored by the police. The island is facing one of its greatest socioeconomic crises since the Soviet Union collapsed as well as a rise of deadly coronavirus outbreaks. Worsening conditions, such as the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a frightening scarcity of food, medication, and other necessities, are among the causes for the protests, which are among the greatest since the dictatorship began in the 1950s. According to the American daily newspaper Miami Herald, videos live-streamed on Facebook showed thousands of people walking and riding bikes and motorcycles along streets while chanting ""Freedom!"" ""Down with Communism!"" and ""Patria y Vida"" -- Homeland and Life -- which has become a battle cry among activists after a viral music video turned the revolutionary slogan ""Homeland or Death"" on its head.

On Sunday, thousands took to the streets in cities and towns across the long-suffering nation, screaming ""Freedom"" and ""Enough"" -- as well as anti-government slogans and demands for the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The dictatorship responded with a huge police presence, dispatching special forces jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested in the countrys capital, Havana.

Cuba: Thousands Nationwide Take Streets Against Communism,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-thousands-nationwide-take-streets-against-communism/,07/12/21,www.breitbart.com,"Thousands of Cubans in at least 16 cities took the streets peacefully on Sunday to demand an end to the 62-year-old communist regime, chanting ""freedom,"" wearing American flags, and in many cases facing extreme police repression. Videos from throughout the island show both plain-clothed and uniformed state security officers attacking peaceful protesters. In Havana, bystanders recorded the sound of heavy gunfire and public beatings of dissidents. Miguel Diaz-Canel, the ""president"" appointed by Raul Castro to be the face of the still-ruling Castro Communist Party, called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime in a speech on Sunday. The protests appeared to begin in the town of San Antonio de los Banos, western Cuba, on Sunday morning. Local independent outlets documented chants of ""down with communism!"", ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"", among other anti-government statements. Locals livestreamed the protest on Facebook, triggering an outpouring into the streets of at least 16 major cities including both Havana and Santiago de Cuba, on opposite ends of the island. The geographically widespread nature of the protests and the secrecy of the Communist Party on the island has made it virtually impossible to estimate exactly how many Cubans took the streets on Sunday. Police have not released any arrest totals or injury statistics, but some local outlets estimate that hundreds were arrested, taken into police stations but not formally charged or appearing in any law enforcement documentation. Among the arrested were several Cuban journalists not participating but reporting on the protests, according to the dissident news service Cubanet. Also arrested on Sunday, though rapidly released, was Yomil Hidalgo, one of Cubas most popular dance music artists. The American flag, popularized as a protest symbol in Cuba by dissident Daniel Llorente, made multiple appearances among Cubans on Sunday. Video authenticated by the Miami broadcaster AmericaTeve showed a group of Cubans carrying an American flag through the streets of Havana on Sunday while chanting ""freedom!"" Videos taken by Cubans on social media and distributed through other Latin American news organizations also show the presence of the U.S. flag. In Mayabeque, a Havana suburb, a crowd of hundreds congregated in front of an image of the Virgin Mary to pray for an end to the communist regime. At least one participant can be seen wearing an American flag shirt while praying. Pre-Castro Cuba was a majority Catholic nation. Under communism, the regime has outlawed most religious practices it cannot control and regularly persecutes Christians who defy its authority. Fidel Castro sent non-Catholic Christians - primarily Jehovahs Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists - to labor camps alongside suspected LGBT people, writers and critics, and other ""undesirables"" in the 1960s. Reports of the beating and arrest of at least one Catholic priest, Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, surfaced on Sunday. Alvarez reportedly disappeared in Camaguey, one of the most active protest centers, and resurfaced under the custody of the Communist Partys secret police. Camaguey, in the central rural heartland of the island, experienced some of the most violent communist repression on Sunday. Local journalists and citizens recorded police publicly beating protesters. Citizens fought back with rocks - legal weapon ownership in communist Cuba does not exist - in at least one occasion successfully pushing back a police car to protect dissidents in one neighborhood. Citizens appear to begin throwing rocks after police open fire on unarmed, peaceful civilians, hitting at least one man. An extremely dramatic video of Cuban citizens overturning a police car and standing on it in triumph also surfaced on Sunday. Sources differ on where it was taken, but it appears to be in either Havana or Cardenas, a city about 100 miles east of the capital. Other reports indicated heavy gunfire from police at peaceful protesters in Havana. As Havana is one of Cubas most densely populated urban centers, opening fire on a tightly packed crowd would likely result in significant injuries, but Cuban authorities have not issued any reports on the damage police caused at press time. The gunfire was an apparent attempt to keep protesters out of the Plaza of the Revolution, the Spain-based Diario de Cuba reported. The Plaza is the crown jewel of communist architecture in Havana, featuring Soviet-style metal portraits of Fidel Castro, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, and other mass murderers. Diario de Cuba, citing a reporter on the ground, stated that police surrounded the Plaza and deployed a communist mob to wave photos of Fidel Castro. Police carrying baseball bats offered protection to the state-sponsored mob. Photos of the pro-Castro mob in Havana appeared in Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, late Sunday appear to confirm those reports. Diaz-Canel appeared on television Sunday to call all communists to violently attack any protesters, effectively urging civil war. ""We are willing to give our lives. They will have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution,"" Diaz-Canel warned. ""We are willing to do anything."" ""We are convening all revolutionary communists to go out to the streets where these provocations are happening and confront them with firmness,"" he commanded. ""The order of combat is issued, revolutionaries to the streets."" Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

The streets of Havana were quiet on Monday, although there was a heavy police presence and the capitol building, where more than a thousand had congregated the day before, was cordoned off. Outages in mobile internet - the only way many Cubans have of accessing the web - were frequent. Thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades.

""I don't know if this can happen again, because at the moment, Havana is militarized."" ""Still, Cubans are losing their fear,"" he said. Others Reuters spoke to said they hoped there would be no more protests, citing fears of violence, and saying they would prefer there to be more dialogue. The protests erupted amid both Cuba's deepest economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union and a surge in COVID-19 infections that has pushed some hospitals to the edge of collapse in a country that prides itself on its healthcare system. The tightening of decades-old U.S. sanctions under former U.S. President Donald Trump and the pandemic have exacerbated shortages of food and medicine, as well as power outages. A minority of counter-revolutionaries were fomenting unrest, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a more than four-hour-long televised address alongside his Cabinet. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez blamed U.S.-financed mercenaries. In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States stood with the people of Cuba who were ""bravely"" asserting their right to peaceful protest, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Cuban officials should not blame the protests on U.S. sanctions.

Some Cuban celebrities who have to date not touched on sensitive political issues publicly came out in support of the protesters. ""Their voices should be heard and their rights to express themselves respected,"" said singer-songwriter Cimafunk, whose real name is Erik Rodriguez. ""We need to unite and find the path forward together, peacefully."" In Miami, home to a large community of Cuban Americans, hundreds turned out in Little Havana on Sunday to express solidarity and celebrate what they viewed as the beginning of the end. On Twitter, Miami mayor Francis Suarez implored the United States to ""take action."" VIOLENCE Diaz-Canel denounced vandalism that took place during the demonstrations. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel talks to the media, in San Antonio de los Banos, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini ""They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behavior,"" he said. But the president said pro-government supporters had finally restored order, after on Sunday instructing them to fight back and ""defend the revolution"" - orders that caused consternation among some Cubans. Reuters witnesses saw protesters in Havana on Sunday confronted by smaller pro-government counter-rallies, while police officers stopped their attempt to march to Revolution Square. Amnesty International said it had received with alarm reports of ""internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force - including police firing on demonstrators."" Reuters was unable to independently verify the use of firearms. Network monitoring company Kentik said it had observed the entire country go offline for less than 30 minutes at around 4pm on Sunday, followed by several hours of intermittent outages. ""Until very recently, large internet outages were very rare,"" said Doug Madory, Kentik's director of Internet analysis. ""Internet shutdowns are new to Cuba in 2021."" Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks said there was partial disruption to social media and messaging platforms in Cuba on Monday, ""likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba."" The United Nations said it was monitoring the protests and called for the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected. Jose Daniel, the leader of Cuba's largest opposition group, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), was arrested as he left home to join the protest in Santiago de Cuba in the east of the country on Sunday. His whereabouts is unknown, UNPACU activist Zaqueo Baez told Reuters. Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and Amaury Pacheco, two members of a dissident artists' collective that has made headlines spearheading a broader protest movement in Cuba in recent years, were arrested on their way to protest in Havana, Pacheco's partner Iris Ruiz told Reuters. Otero Alcantara was in jail while Pacheco's whereabouts were unknown. Another well-known dissident, Coco Farinas, was arrested as he left home on Monday in the central town of Santa Clara, his mother Alicia Fernandez told Reuters. The Cuban government did not immediately comment on the arrests. Cuba slams dissidents as mercenaries in the pay of the United States and allied with anti-Castro Cuban exiles. ""It feels like a dangerous moment,"" Ruiz said by phone, noting her neighborhood had had no mobile data all day. ""I'm worried about the kind of reprisals they could take against activists - they have been increasingly plying the theory that we are terrorists lately."" Julie Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, called for the immediate release of them and others. Diaz-Canel attacked what he called Washington's hypocrisy for expressing concern when it was fueling the crisis in Cuba with its trade embargo. The United States tightened sanctions on Cuba under Trump, including restricting crucial remittances in the middle of the pandemic. Biden vowed during his campaign to ease some of these measures but has yet to do so, with the White House saying it was not among his top priorities. ""Is it not very hypocritical and cynical that you block me... and you want to present yourself as the big savior?"" he said. He said the government had been fighting to keep the economy functioning ""in the face of a policy of economic asphyxiation intended to provoke a social uprising.""

Republicans are pointing to unrest in Cuba as evidence that socialist policies ultimately fail, despite a trend among far-left Democrats to embrace them. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana over the weekend to lash out at the worsening conditions in the country under the communist regime, as Cuba faces its worst economic crisis in decades. CUBAN ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS WAVE AMERICAN FLAGS DURING MARCH ""Socialism leads to pain and suffering and Cuba is the perfect example,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a statement. ""Biden must pressure Cuba to provide assurances that they will not fire on their own people. This is a major test for Biden. He must exert leadership and American influence."" Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had particularly strong words against Cuba's system of government. ""Protests in #Cuba arent simply about 'shortages Socialism promises guaranteed food, medicine & income if you give up your freedom,"" Rubio tweeted. ""When, as always, it fails to deliver you dont get your freedom back."" Cruz spoke out against the ""tyranny"" of the Cuban government, noting that his family fled from the country. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS IGNORE CUBAN PROTESTERS RAILING AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP ""The Cuban people have fought against the tyranny of the Communist regime for decades, and have taken to the streets demanding liberty,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""This regime has brutalized and denied freedom to generations of Cubans, forcing many including my family to flee or be murdered, and over the coming days will widen its violence to try to suppress the brave protesters in the streets.""

Biden calls on Cuban regime to 'hear their people and serve their needs' amid rare protests,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/politics/biden-cuba-protests/index.html,07/12/21,www.cnn.com,"(CNN) President Joe Biden on Monday expressed support for the Cuban people amid rare protests in the country over a lack of freedoms and a worsening economy, calling on Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. He continued, ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" White House officials are closely monitoring the protests in the country, 90 miles from the US, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan warning against targeting the peaceful protesters. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. Many chanted for ""freedom"" and called for Diaz-Canel to step down, Reuters reported. Multiple protesters were arrested by police, who used tear gas to break up some demonstrations. Read More",
Large police presence in Cuban capital day after thousands protest,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuban-president-defiant-blames-embargo-after-massive-protests-n1273716,07/12/21,www.nbcnews.com,"A day after thousands of demonstrators took to Cuba's streets in rare protest of the island nation's economic crisis, large contingents of police were dispatched to patrol in the capital of Havana and the island nation's president blamed a U.S. embargo for the widespread shortages of food, fuel, medicine and other goods during the pandemic. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Monday that a ""politics of economic asphyxiation"" was having a ""cumulative effect"" throughout Cuba. He and representatives from his government said U.S. sanctions against Cuba had contributed to power outages and limited access to food and medical supplies during the pandemic. Speaking of the economic issues in Cuban society and the reasons some have been protesting, Diaz-Canel said, ""What is their origin, what is their cause? It is the blockade."" Diaz-Canel said the Cuban protests were the result of a U.S. and social media campaign to manipulate people while the island is facing hardship during the pandemic. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets across the country on Sunday, shouting slogans against the government such as, ""We want freedom"" and ""We are no longer afraid."" Rights groups and opposition activists reported dozens were unaccounted for or detained on Monday following the protests. But outages in internet connectivity made it difficult to determine the scope of arrests. Cuban police patrolled in the capital of Havana in large numbers on Monday, according to The Associated Press. A man is arrested during a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on Sunday. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images Diaz-Canel said it was legitimate ""to have dissatisfactions, but also we have to be capable to visualize, to define when we're being manipulated, where they want to separate us."" He said forces that want to appear as ""saviors"" to Cuba ""are not interested in the health of the people."" ""They want to change a system, or a regime they call it, to impose what type of government and what type of regime in Cuba? The privatization of public services. The kind that gives more possibility to the rich minority and not the majority."" Cuba's health minister said that the embargo has impacted Cuba's ability to combat the virus through restrictions on medications and supplies to make medicines, as well as equipment such as ventilators. Diaz-Canel also denounced what he called the ""Cuban mafia"" in Miami, referring to Cuban American community members and legislators opposed to the Communist government. Cuba is currently facing its worst economic crisis in decades, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, worsened by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic drove tourism, which was a critical driver of the island economy, to a halt. The country has since seen food shortages, power outages and mounting coronavirus cases. It has also seen an increase in repression against political opponents and a strained health system during a critical stage of the pandemic. Health authorities reported almost 7,000 new cases and 47 deaths -- a record for infections and deaths on the Caribbean island of just over 11 million people. Plainclothes police detain a protester in Havana on Sunday. Ramon Espinosa / AP In Havana, protests disrupted traffic on Sunday until police moved in after several hours and broke up the march when a few protesters threw rocks, according to the AP. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-aged protester told the AP. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later. Later, about 300 pro-government protesters arrived with a large Cuban flag, shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution, the AP reported. Some assaulted an AP videojournalist, smashing his camera. AP photojournalist Ramon Espinosa was then beaten by a group of police officers in uniforms and civilian clothes; he suffered a broken nose and an eye injury. The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages, the AP reported. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon. More than two hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba. ""I know my family in Cuba is struggling, people are dying. Its terrible,"" Miami resident Christian Guzman told NBC station WTVJ. ""Right now, its hard. Theres no food, theres no medicine. The Covid outbreak. The whole country is in the streets,"" Miami resident Dario Suarez said. Diaz-Canel appeared on national television earlier to call on the army to confront the protesters: ""The order to fight has been given,"" he said. Diaz-Canel also called ""all the revolutionaries in the country, all the communists, to take to the streets and go to the places where these provocations are going to take place."" U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday said he recognized the ""remarkable protests in Cuba"" and that such demonstrations had not been seen in a long time, ""frankly ever."" Biden said the U.S. stands ""firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights"" and called on the government to ""refrain from violence"" or ""attempts to silence"" the protesters. Earlier Monday, Biden said in a statement the Cuban protests were a ""clarion call for freedom."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" he added. Also on Monday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called for the U.S. embargo of Cuba to end. ""The truth is that if one wanted to help Cuba, the first thing that should be done is to suspend the blockade of Cuba as the majority of countries in the world are asking,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference, according to Reuters.",
Cuba: Communists Issue 'Order of Combat' Against Peaceful Protesters,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-communists-issue-order-of-combat-against-peaceful-protesters/,07/12/21,www.breitbart.com,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the face of the Castro communist regime, announced an ""order of combat"" on Sunday against peaceful pro-democracy protesters, urging communist civilians to assault them. Thousands of Cubans nationwide, in at least 20 municipalities including Havana and Santiago de Cuba, flooded the streets of the country on Sunday in peaceful protests demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. With chants of ""freedom!"" and some wearing or waving American flags, the protesters attracted outsized police violence. Videos taken by civilians and posted to social media show protesters facing live gunshots, receiving gang beatings at the hands of state security officers, and fleeing from tear gas and rubber bullets. In remarks on national television, Diaz-Canel encouraged violence against the protesters not just on the part of the police, but on the part of Cuban civilians who sympathize with the regime. ""We will not hand over our sovereignty, or the independence of the people, or the freedom of this nation. We are many revolutionaries in this people who are willing to give our lives ... for conviction,"" Diaz-Canel said, according to the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma. ""They have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution and we are willing to do everything and will be on the streets combatting."" ""This is why we are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Diaz-Canel urged. The Castro underling declared an ""order of combat"" against the peaceful protesters and accused them of being ""annexationists."" ""We will not allow any mercenary counterrevolutionary bought off the by the government of the United States, a sellout to the Empire ... to destabilize our country,"" he asserted. No evidence has surfaced since the protests began of any American government influence in the protests, nor have any reports surfaced of American citizens being involved at press time. Some protesters did take the streets waving the American flag or wearing American flag clothing, as the flag has become a global symbol of human rights and freedom - most prominent in this context during the 2019 Hong Kong anti-communist protests. The Castro regime attempted to organize pro-communist rallies on Sunday in response to the massive outpouring of rejection for the regime, shutting down Havanas Plaza of the Revolution and bringing in government cronies. The pro-Castro mobs were dwarfed by the thousands in nearly every major city in the country calling for an end to the regime. Cuban government officials have not released any official estimates on how many people participated in the protests or how many were arrested. As the protests erupted spontaneously, no dissident group has any realistic sense of just how many people took the streets. Most major journalistic outlets are estimating the number of protesters to be in the thousands, however, fueled largely by the rallies in Havana, Santiago, and Camaguey. The anti-Castro outlet ADN Cuba reported that as many as 20 localities nationwide documented protests; it also reported at least one beaten to death in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba. Protesters were largely peaceful but endured a violent crackdown. Isolated incidents occurred in which protesters flipped over a police car - in response to police attempting to assault protesters - and at least one incident of looting of a government-run store. Much more commonly, protesters chanted ""freedom!"" and ""down with communism!"" in many protests, while others targeted Diaz-Canel personally, though he serves largely as a figurehead for the larger Castro family apparatus. Videos surfacing on social media before the regime cut access to the internet appear to reflect the sound of gunshots from police in Havana and locals reported multiple civilians injured. Camaguey, Guantanamo, and Matanzas also reported police street beatings, gunshots, and use of tear gas to deter protesters. No reports have surfaced of any protester carrying a weapon, though some attempted to throw rocks at police officers beating fellow protesters in the street. In addition to the protesters, multiple reports have surfaced of violent beatings and arrests of journalists. Among the most dramatic images to come out of the protests is that of Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa, who police assaulted for unknown reasons while doing his job in Havana. Police raids appeared to continue in the early morning hours of Monday. ADN Cuba reported that at least one Havana neighborhood woke up to police gunshots against people believed to be protesters. An anonymous source in Havana told the outlet that police special forces were hunting suspected protesters ""like dogs"" and that any attempt to resist arrests, beatings, or worse was largely futile without weapons. In Cardenas, Matanzas province, reports surfaced on Monday of families attempting to visit relatives in the hospital after police shot them and having police keep them out of the hospitals. Police have prevented protesters and journalists from compiling an accurate list of those injured or killed on Sunday. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
Cubans protesting communism with American flag because it's a symbol of freedom: Rep.

Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., called on the U.S. to support protests in Cuba to end communist rule, Monday, arguing on ""America Reports"" that America is the symbol of freedom that has been denied to the Cuban people for 60 years. REPUBLICANS SPOTLIGHT CUBA AS SOCIALISM FAILURE AS PROTESTS ERUPT AMID HISTORIC ECONOMIC CRISIS REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ: The people of Cuba want their freedom. They want freedom to speak freely. They want freedom of the press. They want free and democratic elections. They want basic human rights, which have been denied to them for 60 years. And so what you're seeing now is the young people that have actually grown up in the system have figured out, hey, this system doesn't work for us, it doesn't work for anybody, has never worked for anybody, and we want freedom. And so, again, if they've lost the fear of the government and the security forces, then it could be a really good sign that this is the beginning of the end. We in the United States have to support this effort by the young people and the Cuban people for their freedom. We need to also continue the sanctions that that President Trump started a couple of years ago, deny them access to credit, because that's what's happening. The Cuban government cannot pay their bills and they haven't been able to pay their bills for years. So credit is being denied to them. That's why these shortages they have and food and medicines and all that, all because of the failed economic policies of communism. And let's call it what it is. It's communism. And that's the root cause. ... Look at the images coming out of Cuba, right. They've got people there waving the American flag because that is the symbol of freedom. And that's why my family brought me here to this country and that's why I'm in Congress, to fight to make sure that America stays free. WATCH THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW BELOW:",
Thousands march in Cuba in rare mass protests amid economic crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jul/12/thousands-march-in-cuba-in-rare-mass-protests-amid-economic-crisis,07/12/21,www.theguardian.com,"The biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba, as thousands took to the streets in cities throughout the island, demonstrating against food shortages, high prices and communist rule. The protests began in the morning, in the town of San Antonio de los Banos in the west of the island, and in the city of Palma Soriano in the east. In both cases protesters numbered in the hundreds. With millions of Cubans now with mobile internet on their phones, news of the protests quickly swept to Havana. By early afternoon, thousands marched through central Havana, chanting ""homeland and life"" and ""freedom"". ""Im here because of hunger, because theres no medicine, because of power cuts - because theres a lack of everything,"" said a man in his 40s who didnt want to give his name for fear of reprisals. ""I want a total change: a change of government, multiparty elections, and the end of communism."" The protesters were met by uniformed and plainclothes police officers, who bundled hundreds of demonstrators - many of them violent - into police cars. Youths tore up paving slabs and hurled them at police; police used pepper spray and beat protesters with truncheons. One policeman, hit on the head with a cobblestone, was sped away in a car that nearly ran over a protester. With a rock in each hand, Yusniel Perez, 17, said: ""Were here because were hungry and poor. We dont have food. We dont have anything."" At 3pm local time all television channels were interrupted with a broadcast from President Miguel Diaz-Canel who said that ""destabilisation in our country"" would be met with a ""revolutionary response"". ""We call upon all the revolutionaries of the country, all the communists, to take to the streets."" A game of cat and mouse ensued, where young anti-government protesters tried to occupy iconic parts of the capital, only to be blocked off by older government supporters, state security and the army. Aylin Guerrero, 52, was one of thousands who came out to support the government, in central Havana. ""We are the people and we have come out to support our conquests"", she said, surrounded by thousands of government supporters some bearing wooden clubs. ""Even if were not communists, were patriots."" Government supporters accused anti-government protesters of being mercenaries paid by the United States, which spend approximately 20 million dollars a year on ""democracy promotion"" on the island. As evening fell, state forces and supporters had reclaimed the streets. Government supporters gathering at the Maximo Gomez monument in Havana on Sunday. Photograph: Eliana Aponte/AP The protests were concentrated in Havanas more impoverished municipalities. The underlying grievance of those interviewed was longstanding scarcity and privation. Cubans are living through the gravest economic crisis the country has known for 30 years. The Trump administration hammered the island with more than 200 new sanctions aimed at sabotaging the islands economy and stirring discontent, measures that have so far been left untouched by the Biden administration. Since the pandemic, which has gutted tourism revenue, Cubans have become accustomed to waiting in line for hours to buy basic goods like chicken and detergent. Pharmacy shelves are barren.

An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sundays demonstrations. Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for western hemisphere affairs, tweeted: ""Peaceful protests are growing in Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising Covid cases/deaths & medicine shortages.

Candidate Biden supported restoring diplomatic relations with communist Cuba,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-candidate-supported-diplomatic-relations-cuba,07/12/21,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! While on the campaign trail, President Biden said he would restore Obama-era diplomatic ties with Cuba -- despite the nations close ties with Venezuela's strongman Nicolas Maduro. During an appearance on CBS Miami in April 2020, then-candidate Biden was asked if he would restore Obamas policy of engagement with the communist country. ""Yes, I would. In large part, I would go back,"" Biden said. ""Id still insist they keep the commitments they said they would make when we, in fact, set the policy in place."" In 2014, President Obama moved to normalize relations with Cuba, effectively undoing more than 50 years of U.S. policy - including a trade embargo - with the island nation. Then in 2017, President Trump reversed his predecessors policy on Cuba, calling it a ""terrible and misguided deal."" In the April 2020 interview, Biden downplayed the idea that he would be rewarding Cuba despite them propping up Maduro in Venezuela. CUBAN PRESIDENT URGES COUNTRY'S 'REVOLUTIONARY CITIZENS TO COUNTER PROTESTERS ""Well, theyre having great difficulty propping up Maduro,"" Biden said. ""Number one, Maduro is in real trouble. Number two, theres no reason why we cannot still sanction them, but failing to recognize them at all is a different thing than sanctioning them."" While campaigning for reelection, Trumps team said Biden would be following ""Bernie Sanders lead and side with socialist dictatorships over our countrys values."" ""It's bad enough that as vice president, Biden never lifted a finger to stop Maduro as he starved his own people and that his administration praised Raul Castro, giving the Cuban government a pass despite its horrific human rights record,"" Trump campaigns deputy communications director, Ali Pardo said. ""Now, just like Biden sold out Americans while his son Hunter made millions doing business with communist China, he's selling out the Cuban and Venezuelan people to win over the  chavista wing of the Democrat Party."" SANDERS LOVES TRASHING REPUBLICANS BUT WON'T CONDEMN TRULY OPPRESSIVE CUBAN COMMUNISTS Though Biden pledged to restore the Obama-era policy, he has yet to do so as president.

NYT on Cuba Protests: 'Freedom' Is an 'Anti-Government Slogan',https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/new-york-times-cuba-protests-freedom-is-anti-government-slogan/,07/12/21,www.breitbart.com,"The New York Times described chants of ""freedom!"" at thousands-strong peaceful protests in Cuba on Sunday as one of several ""anti-government slogans"" popular among the congregated. The Times also erroneously reported the protests were about ""food and medicine shortages."" ""Shouting 'Freedom and other anti-government slogans, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets in cities around the country on Sunday to protest food and medicine shortages, in a remarkable eruption of discontent not seen in nearly 30 years,"" the Times wrote. In reality, the thousands of protesters used slogans against socialism and communism to made clear the political nature of their demand: the end of communism on the island. The Times coverage also included weaponizing Cuban disinformation by suggesting communist Cubas ""longstanding economic problems"" stem from ""the American trade embargo, which cuts off its access to financing and imports."" ""In televised remark,"" the Times persisted, ""Diaz-Canel said ... the protests were a form of 'systemic provocation by dissidents doing the bidding of the United States."" ""Within hours of the extraordinary events, the president broke into national television programming to urge government supporters to hit the streets and confront the protesters,"" the Times reported, tempering in its translation that Diaz-Canel issued an ""order of combat"" encouraging civilians to violently assault protesters on the streets. The Times narrow coverage contradicts videos from throughout the island that show both plain-clothed and uniformed state security officers attacking peaceful protesters. Breitbart News reported bystanders in Havana heard sounds of heavy gunfire and beatings of dissidents, while Diaz-Canel called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime. The Times has been historically sympathetic to the Castro regime. In the 1950s, while most Cubans supported efforts against then-President Fulgencio Batista organized by more popular leaders, New York Times reporter Herbert Matthews published flattering, and false, reports praising Fidel Castro and his band of Marxists. Matthews reports, beginning in 1957, portrayed Castro as a freedom fighter seeking to restore democracy to the island nation and made him appear far more popular than he was on the island. Matthews articles dignified Castros image, giving him credibility both at home and abroad and helping propel his rise to power. Upon Castros success of establishing a revolutionary socialist state in 1959, Castro claimed in New York City his ""greatest ploy"" was fooling Matthews. Castro admitted he only had 20 men left at the time of Matthews publications but convinced Matthews he had control of a huge army. Matthews observations backed this as he wrote, ""from the look of things, General Batista cannot possibly hope to suppress the Castro revolt."" In 2017, the New York Times published a series of articles praising the legacy of communism, which has killed at least 100 million people.",
Cuba: Police Leave AP Photographer Bloody After Public Beating,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/cuba-police-leave-ap-photographer-bloody-after-public-beating/,07/12/21,www.breitbart.com,"Communist Party security forces in Cuba brutally assaulted an Associated Press photographer and several other international journalists attempting to cover protests against the regime on Sunday, leaving them visibly injured. Beginning Sunday morning, thousands of Cubans spontaneously gathered in at least 20 cities across the island to protest the communist regime, waving American flags and chanting ""freedom."" Havana has responded with brutal methods to suppress the demonstrators, using police force and evidently, live rounds, the discharge of which protesters have filmed. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, Raul Castros public figurehead, called for street ""combat"" against the agitators in a bellicose Sunday speech. ""We are willing to give our lives. They will have to pass over our corpses if they want to confront the Revolution,"" he said. ""The order of combat is issued, revolutionaries to the streets."" Reportedly beginning in San Antonio de los Banos, a town in the islands West, Facebook livestreams of protesters shouting ""down with communism!"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" prompted nationwide outbursts of anti-regime expressions. The regimes violent suppression of the demonstrators has spread to journalists documenting their activities. Associated Press (AP) reporter Ramon Espinosa appeared in graphic photos from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in which Cuban authorities attempt to restrain Espinosa. He was photographing the Havana protests. Subsequent photos depicted Espinosa, visibly injured, with blood covering his face from his eyes to his chin. Dark lines underscored his left eye and blood trickled from his nostrils, indicating he sustained multiple blows to the head between photos. Faced with considerable police violence, the demonstrators themselves have begun to speak of armed uprising. Following police gunfire in El Cerro, Havana, on Monday morning, an anonymous Cuban youth told ADN Cuba that unarmed demonstrators are helpless against the communist forces -- ""Sin armas somos un pastel para las moscas"" -- ""without weapons, we are a pastry for the flies."" ""We need weapons, something, I dont know,"" he continued. He was nonetheless resolute, saying ""we are going to give it all we have!""

""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" the statement said, ignoring that bystanders recorded sounds of heavy gunfire and public beatings of dissidents. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,"" the statement continued. Bidens comments are a response to an outpouring of opposition to the 62-year-old Castro regime on Sunday, attracting thousands of protesters nationwide. The protesters chanted slogans against the communist dictatorship to demand the end of communism in Cuba and shouted ""freedom"" - a fact lost on American mainstream outlets falsely claiming the protests were a response to the nations handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Videos from the island depict state security officers clothed in official and non-official uniforms attacking peaceful protesters. Breitbart News reported Monday bystanders in Havana heard sounds of gunfire and beatings of protestors, while ""President"" Diaz-Canel called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime. The communist government has not released any arrest totals or injury statistics, but some local outlets estimate that hundreds were arrested, taken into police stations but not formally charged or appearing in any law enforcement documentation. Breitbart News also reported several Cuban journalists not participating but reporting on the protests were arrested, along with Yomil Hidalgo, a popular Cuban dance music artist. Cubans also harnessed Old Glory throughout the protest, chanting ""freedom,"" which Latin American news organizations reported.",

(AFP) Cuba has blamed a US ""policy of economic suffocation"" for unprecedented anti-government protests, as US President Joe Biden backed called to end ""decades of repression"" on the communist island. Thousands of Cubans took part in demonstrations on Sunday, chanting: ""Down with the dictatorship,"" as President Miguel Diaz-Canel urged supporters to confront demonstrators. The anti-government rallies erupted spontaneously in several cities as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years, with chronic shortages of electricity and food.

""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" The strongly-worded statement was sure to anger Cuba's leaders, who say Washington is stirring up the rare mass street protests in the authoritarian country. The Biden administration -- focused on domestic challenges including battling Covid-19 and passing infrastructure legislation, while also withdrawing from the 20-year war in Afghanistan -- has largely ignored Cuba until now.

Police used tear gas to disperse crowds, and at least ten people were arrested, while officers used plastic pipes to beat protesters, AFP journalists witnessed. US-Cuba relations have been particularly fraught since then-president Donald Trump reinforced the blockade following a historic but temporary easing of tensions under Barack Obama between 2014 and 2016. The tougher measures, left unchanged by Biden, and the effects of the coronavirus epidemic contributed to Cuba's economy declining 11 percent in 2020. Public anger in the one-party state has been growing, driven by long food lines, worsening power shortages and a critical shortage of medicines.

In a statement issued Monday, 24 hours after protesters first took to the streets, the White House said it supported ""the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" the statement read. ""Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves.""

""We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki seemed to waffle Monday on the question of whether the protests were related to immediate events or if they reflected longstanding anger. ""There is every indication that yesterdays protests were spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression and these are protests inspired by the harsh reality of everyday life in Cuba,"" she said. Psaki declined to give a direct response when asked whether the Biden administration supports protesters using the American flag as a symbol of their struggle for freedom, saying only that ""the president certainly respects the symbol of the American flag"" and adding that while Biden displays it at his home, he ""also believes people have the right to peaceful protest."" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the son of Cuban immigrants, did issue a statement of his own Sunday that trumpeted a ""historic day of protests"". ""For decades, Cubas dictatorship has used violence and repression to silence its people, rather than permit the free exercise of democracy and their basic social rights,"" Menendez wrote. ""This must end. The worlds eyes are on Cuba tonight and the dictatorship must understand we will not tolerate the use of brute force to silence the aspirations of the Cuban people. ""As Ive said over the years, no one wishes that the reality in Cuba was more different than the Cuban people and Cuban-Americans that have fled the island in search of freedom,"" the senator added.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) -- Large contingents of Cuban police patrolled the capital of Havana on Monday following rare protests around the island nation against food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis. Cubas president said the demonstrations were stirred up on social media by Cuban Americans in the United States. Sundays protests marked some of the biggest displays of antigovernment sentiment in the tightly controlled country in years. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trumps administration. Many young people took part in demonstrations in Havana. Protests were also held elsewhere on the island, including in the small town of San Antonio de los Banos, where people objected to power outages and were visited by President Miguel Diaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents. Authorities appeared determined to put a stop to the demonstrations. More than a dozen protesters were detained, including a leading Cuban dissident who was arrested trying to attend a march in the city of Santiago, 559 miles (900 kilometers) east. The demonstrators disrupted traffic in the capital for several hours until some threw rocks and police moved in and broke them up. ADVERTISEMENT Internet service was spotty, possibly indicating an effort to prevent protesters from communicating with each other. ""Weve seen how the campaign against Cuba was growing on social media in the past few weeks,'' Diaz-Canel said Monday in a nationally televised appearance in which his entire Cabinet was also present. ""Thats the way its done: Try to create inconformity, dissatisfaction by manipulating emotions and feelings."" In a statement Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden said Cuban protesters were asserting their basic rights. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,'' Biden said. The U.S. urges the Cuban government to serve their people rather than enriching themselves,'' Biden added. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq on Monday stressed the U.N. position ""on the need for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected fully, and we expect that that will be the case."" The demonstrations were extremely unusual on an island where little dissent against the government is tolerated. The last major public demonstration of discontent, over economic hardship, took place nearly 30 years in 1994. Last year, there were small demonstrations by artists and other groups, but nothing as big or widespread as what erupted this past weekend. In the Havana protest on Sunday, police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted, ""Freedom!"" ""Enough!"" and ""Unite!"" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. ""We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. Thats why Im here,"" one middle-age protester told The Associated Press. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later. ADVERTISEMENT Later, about 300 pro-government protesters arrived with a large Cuban flag, shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some assaulted an AP videojournalist, smashing his camera. AP photojournalist Ramon Espinosa was then beaten by a group of police officers in uniforms and civilian clothes; he suffered a broken nose and an eye injury. The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon Sunday. On Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, said Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. ""This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,"" he said. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba has the ability to cut it off if it wants to.",

Cuban president claims protests part of US plot to 'fracture' Communist party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/12/cuba-protests-economic-crisis-president-miguel-diaz-canel,07/12/21,www.theguardian.com,"The Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has attacked the ""shameful delinquents"" he claimed were trying to ""fracture"" his countrys communist revolution after the Caribbean island witnessed its largest anti-government protests in nearly three decades. As Cuban officials blamed the US for Sundays demonstrations, Joe Biden called on the islands leaders to hear its citizens ""clarion call for freedom"". ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" Biden said in a statement. In a televised address on Monday morning Diaz-Canel, who recently succeeded Raul Castro as the Communist partys top figure, painted the protests as part of a United States-backed, social media-driven plot to stir up public discontent and overthrow the Cuban regime. ""The approach wasnt peaceful yesterday,"" the 61-year-old politician claimed, criticising the ""completely vulgar"" behaviour of some demonstrators who he accused of throwing rocks at police and destroying cars. Diaz-Canel conceded other protesters had legitimate concerns over food shortages and blackouts, although he blamed those problems on US sanctions. ""Its legitimate to feel dissatisfaction,"" the partys powerful first secretary said in the broadcast. Rogelio Polanco Fuentes, a top party official who runs its ideology department, denounced the protests as part of a well-funded US-sponsored effort to create ""instability and chaos"" in Cuba, which is currently experiencing its worst economic slump in decades as well as a worsening Covid crisis. Polanco Fuentes compared Sundays protests to the failed US-backed uprising against Venezuelas authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, in 2019. ""We are living through new chapters of the non-conventional war ... in other places they have called these Colour Revolutions ... or soft coups,"" Polanco said. Cuban dissidents rejected those claims about the protests which rippled across Cuba on Sunday, with thousands taking to the streets to denounce the lack of medicine and food and the lack of political freedoms. By Sunday afternoon the demonstrations had reached one of Cubas most iconic locations: the seafront Malecon in the capital Havana where thousands of protesters were seen chanting ""homeland and life"" and ""freedom"". The Malecon promenade was the setting of Cubas last significant street demonstrations, a sudden and short-lived explosion of dissent in 1994 known as the ""Maleconazo Uprising"". ""What is happening is absolutely historical for us ... I think this is a point of no return. Things will never be there same after this,"" said Carolina Barrero, a 34-year-old Havana-based activist. ""We are talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of people, all across the island. In every little town there was protest, [it was] completely spontaneous. ""They were shouting: 'We dont have fear any more! 'We want freedom! and 'Abajo la dictadura! (Down with the dictatorship!)"" added Barrero, an art historian who said she had recently been placed under house arrest after being detained reading a poem outside Cubas culture ministry. Paul Hare, the former British ambassador in Havana, said Cubas leaders would be concerned by the highly unusual eruption of dissent, and particularly how it had been organized with the help of social media. Word of the protests spread rapidly on Sunday, as celebrities and influencers shared news of the marches using the hashtag #SOSCuba. ""What Cubas government has always dreaded is a coordinated movement, as opposed to sporadic protests ... They see it as the possible genesis of an organized rival political movement,"" Hare said. ""The hardliners will be saying: 'Be careful - this could get out of hand ... They will be worried [about the protests]. It is a sign that the Communist party is no longer able to vertically dictate what policy should be,"" Hare added. Cuban activists said they were unimpressed with Diaz-Canels initial response to their demands, and particularly his call on Sunday for ""revolutionaries"" to hit the streets to confront protesters provocations ""with firmness and bravery"". ""What worries me the most is how they are trying to lay the ground for a wave of repression,"" said Claudia Genlui Hidalgo, a 30-year-old dissident who saw several friends arrested on Sunday. ""When he says 'revolutionaries to the street, hes inciting violence."" Barrero said she hoped the protests would lead to a peaceful transition away from one-party rule but was also troubled by the possibility of conflict and by Diaz-Canels description of the protests as ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"". Hare predicted there would now be a political crackdown on those identified as protest ringleaders as Communist party security chiefs fought to prevent a repeat. World leaders reacted to Cubas unexpected convulsion on Monday with Mexicos president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, saying he hoped a peaceful resolution could be reached ""without the use of force, without confrontation and without violence"". ""The Cubans must decide [the solution] because Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation - there must be no interventionism,"" Lopez Obrador added. A spokesperson for Russias foreign ministry also cautioned against ""outside interference"" that sought to ""encourage the destabilization"" of the communist-run island.",
Biden backs Cuban protests as island's president blames 'imperialist' provocations,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-backs-cuban-protests-islands-president-blames-imperialist/story?id=78798057,07/12/21,abcnews.go.com,"President Joe Biden on Monday stood in solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who protested over the weekend about shortages and rising prices for food and medicine amid the coronavirus pandemic in what's being called an unprecedented rejection of the island nation's government. Biden, speaking to reporters at a White House meeting Monday, addressed what he called ""the remarkable protests"" in Cuba of people ""demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" ""And I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- if, quite frankly, ever. And the United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights, and we call on the government, the government of Cuba, to refrain from violence and their attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba,"" he said. Cuba's communist leadership has already denounced the protests as a ""systemic provocation"" by Cuban dissidents and the U.S. government, encouraged its supporters to counter-protest, and sent its armed forces into the streets, risking clashes with demonstrators. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden said, ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime."" ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves,"" he said. Sunday's protests, in several cities across the island, are some of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in Cuba's recent history, and Biden had been called on to show support for the protests. While he helped the Obama administration's efforts to ease tensions with Cuba and reopen trade and travel, Biden has kept most of former President Donald Trump's sanctions and restrictions in place on America's close neighbor and longtime adversary. The administration says it is still reviewing its Cuba policy, earning the ire of progressives in the Democratic Party, but with these nearly unprecedented demonstrations, it may have to move more quickly than it hoped. So far, the administration has voiced support for the Cuban people's right to peacefully assemble and condemned any violence. Prior to Biden's statement, acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Julie Chung and Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan weighed in with that sentiment. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged public grievances over blackouts and food and medicine shortages during a televised address Monday, but he blamed the island nation's problems on the long-standing U.S. embargo and accused American ""imperialists"" of stoking tensions on social media. ""Yesterday, Cuba lived the most heroic day. Thousands of patriotic people defend the Revolution,"" he said on state television, referring to pro-government demonstrations in Havana later on Sunday that numbered around 300, according to the Associated Press. ""We do not want to hurt our beloved people,"" added Diaz-Canel, who assumed the presidency in 2019 and became the first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party this April, officially taking over for Raul Castro. Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla had even sharper words Monday, firing back at Sullivan and Chung's statements of support for protests by saying the White House has ""no political or moral authority to speak about Cuba."" ""His government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to promote subversion in our country & implements a genocidal blockade, which is the main cause of economic scarcities,"" he tweeted, referring directly to Sullivan's statement. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, with its economy contracting by double-digits last year. But along with the economic crisis, the country is dealing with another deadly surge of COVID-19. ABC News' Christine Theodorou and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",
"Miami mayor blasts far-left silence on Cuban protests, says crisis exposes fallacy of socialism",https://www.foxnews.com/media/miami-mayor-blasts-far-left-silence-cuban-protests-crisis-exposes-fallacy-socialism,07/12/21,www.foxnews.com,"Miami Republican Mayor Francis Suarez called out the far-left's silence over the pro-democracy protests in Cuba, which has been ruled by decades of Communist dictatorship, and told Fox News the latest unrest exposes the ""false promise"" of socialism. Suarez, whose father Xavier was the city's first Cuban-born mayor, told ""Your World"" guest host Sandra Smith on Monday that it is unbelievable that anyone would fail to condemn Communist ideology. ""[It] has failed not just in Cuba but in the history of humanity--this is an ideology that promises to create equality. The only equality it has delivered is equal misery for all of its citizens in every country that its been tried,"" he said. ""It's time for the United States to understand that. It's time for us to understand this could affect American cities if we're not careful."" Suarez added that socialism provides people a ""false promise"" and in practice means the government takes away peoples' property and freedoms. ""The truth of the matter is, it's never worked and never going to work and the United States has to start intervening and finding a way, whether it's through humanitarian aid, military intervention, whatever means necessary to protect the sovereignty of the Cuban people and the sovereignty of the United States in this hemisphere,"" he said. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, who is also head of the Communist Party, released a statement that warned the ""Cuban Revolution is not going to turn the other cheek to those who attack it in virtual and real spaces,"" and that his government will ""avoid revolutionary violence, but will repress counterrevolutionary violence."" Suarez said the communist regime is a ""drug-trafficking dictatorship"" that sponsors terrorism and exports its dangerous political system throughout the world. ""And so, it affects U.S. interests. That's something that sometimes is not emphasized enough: How this affects U.S. National security policy,"" he said. ""And I think the U.S. has to understand that these kinds of regimes that are enslaving not just Cubans, but Nicaraguans and Venezuelans... impact our sovereignty and our security."" ""The U.S. has a vested interest and a right to intervene on behalf of the Cuban people but also on behalf of the United States and creating an international coalition is important,"" he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor referenced Fox News correspondent Phil Keating's report outside Versailles, a famous Cuban restaurant on US-41 in Little Havana, where people waved Cuban flags and shouted pro-democracy slogans. ""The Cuban people have no food, as was stated by [Keating]. They have no access to medical care, particularly being devastated by the coronavirus and most importantly they want freedom. What we have in this country, they want the hope for a better future,"" Suarez said.",
Florida Democrats Condemn DeSantis over Cuba Protests,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/12/desantis-derangement-democrats-condemn-florida-governor-cuba-protests/,07/12/21,www.breitbart.com,"Florida Democrats responded to Governor Ron DeSantis (R) sending support to anti-communist protesters in Cuba on Sunday by attacking the governor, seemingly comparing his administration to the Castro regime. The Republican Partys rising star posted on Twitter sharing a video of the protests, which took place throughout the island and news outlets estimate attracted thousands of people: Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies #SOSCuba Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies#SOSCuba pic.twitter.com/H71EYoKdUZ -- Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) July 11, 2021 Democrats largely responded by criticizing DeSantis for the anti-riot bill he signed into law in April, which increases penalties for people who participate in unruly protests. DeSantis passed the bill in response to Black Lives Matter protests that devolved into violence and looting in major cities across the nation last summer. Notably, Black Lives Matter was founded by ""trained Marxists."" Marxism is the philosophical underpinning of communism, the ruling political system in Cuba, and has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people over several decades, as Breitbart News reported. Unlike the Cuba protests on Sunday, the assemblies the DeSantis bill targets would involve violence on the part of participants, including vandalism, looting, and property destruction. Democrats appear to argue that DeSantis was being hypocritical by supporting peaceful protesters in Cuba while attempting to crack down on violent riots in the United States. ""Says the Governor who pushed through House Bill 1, a bill motivated as a means to silence racial justice protests,"" State Rep. Anna V. Eskamani (D) tweeted. ""I support the Cuban people as they take to the streets & let their voices be heard & do everything they cant do in Florida without it being labelled [sic] an 'aggravated riot under Ron Desantiss anti-protest law,"" State Rep. Omari Hardy (D) wrote. ""@GovRonDeSantis made this type of protest illegal in Florida. He wants to silence dissent because he fears accountability,"" tweeted Steve Simeonidis, who is the chair for Miami-Dade Democrats. In response to Simeonidis, Republican communicator and former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications deputy Matt Whitlock criticized Democrats rhetoric. He tweeted: Fascinating strategy from a number of Florida Dems. Instead of supporting protestors in Cuba, theyre trying to argue DeSantiss anti-rioting law wouldve prevented similar protests. It wouldnt have, but a good window into why theyre losing the voters theyre losing. Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) also re-tweeted DeSantis in support of Cuban protesters and warned of communisms insidious grasp in the United States. He posted: The same Communist rule the people of Cuba are valiantly protesting as we speak is the same Communism threatening to take hold in America today. May God protect the brave people protesting the tyrannical Cuban regime. May their long-awaited freedom prevail once & for all. President Joe Biden released a statement on Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people"" against their repressive communist regime. However, he failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security, Breitbart News reported. He also failed to condemn socialism and communism. The leftist New York Times, which played a direct role in Fidel Castros takeover of Cuba, also erroneously reported the protests were about ""food and medicine shortages,"" even though local independent outlets documented protesters chanting ""down with communism!"", ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"", among other anti-government statements. The protests appeared to begin in the town of San Antonio de los Banos, western Cuba, on Sunday morning. Locals livestreamed the protest on Facebook, triggering an outpouring into the streets of at least 16 major cities including both Havana and Santiago de Cuba, on opposite ends of the island, Breitbart News reported. So far, local outlets in Cuba are estimating hundreds of arrests. Bystanders recorded the sound of heavy gunfire in Havana and public beatings of dissidents. Miguel Diaz-Canel, the 'president appointed by Raul Castro, called for street ""combat"" against anyone demanding an end to the regime in a speech on Sunday.",
Cuba's internet cutoff: A go-to tactic to suppress dissent,https://apnews.com/article/business-technology-cuba-ca1ae7975e04481e8cbd56d62a7fb30e,07/12/21,apnews.com,"Anti-government protesters march in Havana, Cuba, Sunday, July 11, 2021.

(AP Photo/Eliana Aponte, file) Cubans facing the countrys worst economic crisis in decades took to the streets over the weekend. In turn, authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. On the extreme side, regimes like China and North Korea exert tight control over what regular citizens can access online. Elsewhere, service blockages are more limited, often cutting off common social platforms around elections and times of mass protests. There was no formal organizer of Sundays protests; people found out about the rallying points over social media, mostly on Twitter and Facebook, the platforms most used by Cubans. The thousands of Cubans who took to the streets -- protesters and pro-government activists alike -- wielded smartphones to capture images and send them to relatives and friends or post them online. ADVERTISEMENT On Monday, Cuban authorities were blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, said Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm. ""This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,"" he said. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba could cut it off if it wants to. While the recent easing of access by Cuban authorities to the internet has increased social media activity, Toker said, the level of censorship has also risen. Not only does the cutoff block out external voices, he said, it also squelches ""the internal voice of the population who have wanted to speak out."" Internet access in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. The country was ""basically offline"" until 2008, then gradually entered a digital revolution, said Ted Henken, a Latin America expert at Baruch College, City University of New York. The biggest change, he noted, came in December 2018 when Cubans got access to mobile internet for the first time via data plans purchased from the state telecom monopoly. These days, more than half of all Cubans have internet access, Henken said. Many Cubans now have real-time, anywhere-you-are access to the internet and the ability to share information among themselves, he added. Since early 2019, this access has facilitated regular, if smaller, events and protests on the island. In response, the government has periodically shut down access to social media, mostly to hide its repressive tactics from both citizens and foreigners, he said. The Cuban government also restricts independent media in Cuba and ""routinely blocks access within Cuba to many news websites and blogs,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. The protests now, the largest in decades, are ""absolutely and definitely fueled by increased access to internet and smartphones in Cuba,"" said Sebastian Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. ADVERTISEMENT Social media posts from within and outside of Cuba are ""not the root causes of the rebellion, but they are a factor in connecting the desperation, disaffection that exists in the island,"" said Arturo Lopez-Levy, an assistant political science professor at Holy Names University in California. Lopez-Levy, who grew up a few blocks from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, said the countrys current leader has embraced the economic potential of digital technology far more than his predecessors, but may have calculated that a large segment of Cubans will accept a temporary internet shutdown if it helps restore order in the streets. Elsewhere, government internet shutdowns after or ahead of protests have also become commonplace, whether for a few hours or extending for months. In Ethiopia, there was a three-week shutdown in July 2020 after civil unrest. The internet blackout in the Tigray region has stretched on for months. In Belarus, the internet went down for more than two days after an August 2020 election seen as rigged sparked mass protests. Mobile internet service repeatedly went down during weekend protests for months afterwards. A decade ago during the Arab Spring, when social media was still in its early years and Egypt, Tunisia and other countries in the Middle East faced bloody uprisings that were broadcast on social media, headlines declared the movements ""Twitter Revolutions"" and experts debated about just how important a role social media played in the events. Ten years later, there is no question that social media and private chat platforms have become an essential organizing tool. Restricting them, in turn, is a routine move to suppress dissent. Internet service was disrupted in Cali, Colombia during May anti-government protests. This year has also seen disruptions in Armenia, Uganda, Iran, Chad, Senegal and the Republic of Congo. But authoritarian regimes arent the only ones getting into the act. India routinely shuts down the internet during times of unrest. Toker of NetBlocks said the imposition of internet restrictions in Cuba follows an emerging global pattern and not always in the countries you most expect them, such as a recent Nigerian cutoff of Twitter. On the plus side, he said, the world is much more aware of these incidents because its easier to monitor and report them remotely. On Sunday, all of Cuba went offline for less than 30 minutes, after which there were several hours of intermittent but large outages, said Doug Madory of Kentik, a network management company. He said large internet outages were very rare in Cuba until very recently. ""There was an outage in January just for mobile service following the '27N protests,"" Madory said, referring to a movement of Cuban artists, journalists and other members of civil society who marched on the Ministry of Culture on Nov. 27, 2020, demanding freedom and democracy. Henken said he doesnt believe the government would shut off access for an extended period of time, even though that is its go-to tactic for dissidents and activists. ""The problem they have now is that its not a handful of activists or artists or independent journalists -- its now a massive swath of the population all throughout the country,"" he said. ""So the genie is out of the bottle. Theyre trying to put it back in."" __ AP Havana correspondent Andrea Rodriguez and AP technology reporter Matt OBrien contributed to this article.",
"57 Missing or Imprisoned in Cuba Protests Include Artists, Activists, Priests",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/12/57-missing-imprisoned-cuba-protests-include-artists-peace-activists-priests/,07/12/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Cuban pro-democracy group Cuba Decide confirmed the disappearance or arrest of 57 people since protests erupted throughout the island on Sunday night, many of them prominent critics of the communist regime. Cuba experienced a wave of protests nationwide on Sunday, affecting at least 20 localities from far-west Pinar del Rio to Santiago de Cuba, the capital of Oriente province. Reports estimate thousands took to the streets, chanting ""freedom,"" ""down with communism,"" and other anti-regime slogans. Authorities have not published any official estimates of the number of people protesting and the disparate events nationwide were not organized by any centralized group, so no true number of how many Cubans were on the streets exists. The Communist Party responded to the protests by calling for civil war, urging civilians to violently attack anyone participating in protests. ""This is why we are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Miguel Diaz-Canel, the president of the country and face of the Castro regime, said in a televised address late Sunday. Cuban civilians documented multiple instances throughout the country of state security agents firing live rounds into crowds and beating protesters with baseball bats and other weapons. Witnesses also documented the use of tear gas and other repressive anti-riot gear. Cuba Decide, which advocates for the replacement of the repressive Communist Party autocracy with an election-based democratic system, published the names Monday, stating these are only those whom they can confirm with certainty are missing or in police custody as of 10 a.m. local time Monday. Reporte actualizado con detenidos y/o desaparecidos, hasta las 10 am#SOSCuba pic.twitter.com/Fre0Do52qF -- CUBADECIDE (@CUBADECIDE) July 12, 2021 At the top of the list is a perennial target of Castro repression: Jose Daniel Ferrer, the head of the largest Cuban dissident organization, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU). While UNPACU has not taken credit for organizing any of these protests, it has laid the groundwork for years on exercising peaceful assembly on the island, often at the price of Ferrers arrest. Ferrer most recently disappeared in October 2019 after organizing an anti-communist protest the month before in commemoration of the feast day of Our Lady of Charity, the patroness saint of Cuba. He resurfaced in April 2020, having clearly endured torture at the hands of the regime and suffering from several health conditions that he was diagnosed with during his time in police custody. Police never justified to Ferrer or his family his extended stay in prison. Also missing at press time following the Sunday protests is Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, a Catholic priest who has spent years advocating for the end of authoritarianism in Cuba. Alvarez was one of three priests behind a famous 2018 letter to Raul Castro seeking free elections in Cuba and has used his position as a clergyman to urge a peaceful transition out of communism. Reports on Monday indicated that Cuban state security severely beat Alvarez in his native Camaguey, leaving him with a visible bloody head injury before his disappearance. The priests whereabouts remain unknown. Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, the often-arrested head of a Havana artist dissident group the San Isidro Movement, is also missing at press time. Oteros group was responsible for the largest recent protest in the country prior to this weekend: the storming of the Ministry of Culture in Havana in November. That assembly was in response, in part, to the violent arrest of another member of the San Isidro Movement, rapper Denis Solis, who received an eight-month prison sentence for the crime of ""disrespect"" against a police officer. The officer had entered his apartment illegally, prompting Solis to demand his removal from the premises. Solis filmed the encounter. Amid the dozens of protester disappearances, Cuban police released Solis on Monday. Many other San Isidro members appear on Cuba Decides list of the missing and in custody. The independent outlet 14 y Medio -- run by Cuban journalists on the island who routinely face arrest and persecution -- reported Monday that some neighborhoods of Cuba are experiencing door-to-door police raids. Authorities, it noted, began visiting residences in the early hours of Monday looking for people who participated in the protests to deprive them of their freedoms, eyewitnesses said. ""In my neighborhood they have already taken away two young people and I am waiting for them to come get me since I was at the protests,"" a young man in Artemisa, greater Havana, told the outlet on condition of anonymity. In Camaguey, where Father Alvarez disappeared, residents reported the widespread use on Sunday of ""special forces"" to contain protests, including state security troops firing at protesters and injuring an unknown number. Elsewhere in the country, police chose to attack journalists; one particularly gory exchange left Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosas face broken and bloodied. Other international photographers documented the gang beating of Espinosa with their cameras, at the hands of uniformed Cuban police. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

'Abajo la Dictadura': Cubans make their voices heard,https://nypost.com/2021/07/12/abajo-la-dictadura-cubans-make-their-voices-heard/,07/12/21,nypost.com,"Cubans poured into the streets by the tens of thousands Sunday to protest the Communist governments deadly failures, chanting ""!Ya no tenemos miedo!"" and ""!Abajo la dictadura!"" and ""!Libertad!"" ""Were no longer afraid."" ""Down with the dictatorship."" ""Freedom."" This was no mere complaint about the COVID toll, nor even the regimes refusal to let international relief groups bring in food and medicine. President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded by 1) blaming the United States, 2) shutting down the Internet and 3) ordering police to open fire on the demonstrations and start ""disappearing"" top dissidents. President Joe Biden on Monday . . . issued a perfectly fine statement: ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime.""

Never forget the US left's disgusting love affair with the Castro regime,https://nypost.com/2021/07/12/never-forget-the-us-lefts-love-affair-with-the-castro-regime/,07/12/21,nypost.com,"Its not easy to run a hideous dictatorship and still have fans and defenders in fashionable quarters, but the Castro dictatorship has managed it all of these decades. The mass, spontaneous protests that broke out all over the country last weekend are yet another sign that the Cuban government lacks all legitimacy. In Cuba, it is the government versus the people, and lo, all these years, Castros apologists have been with the government. They have romanticized Fidel Castro, the founder father of Cubas junta. They have swallowed its propaganda. They have made excuses for it. They have looked away from its crimes. And they have blamed America for its manifest failures. If the protests continue in Cuba, there will be an existential struggle between people in the streets displaying American flags and chanting for freedom and an organized crime syndicate that rules by force and has long held the affection of American left. During his presidential campaign last year, Bernie Sanders wouldnt back off his supportive statements about the Castro regime over the years -- yes, the government should be less authoritarian, but it has done so much good. Filmmaker Michael Moore made a popular movie extolling the Cuban health-care system. Upon Fidels death in 2016, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his ""deep sorrow"" at the death of ""Cubas longest serving president"" (when a president jails his opponents, he can indeed stay in office a long time). Cubas regime has long benefited from the romantic image of violent Latin American revolutionaries (Che Guevara is a popular progressive mascot), the fact that it is a left-wing, rather than right-wing dictatorship, and that it has always fed off Anti-American sentiments. People protesting the Cuban government and President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 11, 2021 Photo by YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images The rationalizations offered for the regime are tinny and misleading. We are supposed to believe that Cuba was sunk in medieval illiteracy until enlightened Communists came to power who cared above all about social progress and just happened to jail, torture, and kill lots of people in the course of teaching kids to read. But its not true that Cuba was markedly illiterate prior to the advent of the Castro dictatorship; in 1960, the literacy rate was about 80 percent, among the highest in Latin America. Nor is it correct that Castro had benevolent intentions with his literacy campaign; the point was to make it easier to stuff the Cuban people with Communist propaganda. Finally, its wrong to presume that people can only learn to read if they are cowed into submission by Marxist thugs; other Latin American countries achieved massive increases in literacy without throwing people in gulags. Cuba was among the leaders in the region in terms of infant mortality and life expectancy -- two other supposed benefits of communism -- before the revolution. A man getting arrested during a demonstration in Havana, Cuba on July 11, 2021. Photo by YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images The economic historian Brad DeLong has noted that Cuba in 1957 had lower infant mortality than many European countries, more doctors and nurses per capita than Britain or Finland, and as many vehicles per capita as Italy or Portugal. After decades of Castros dictatorship, its per capita GDP ranks with Mongolia and Bhutan, according to CIA figures. This suggests, correctly, that Castro took over a country in pretty good shape and wrecked it, rather than the other way around. The governments failures are always blamed on the US embargo. If it werent for the US strictures, on this view, Cuba would be the one Marxist economy in the world able to deliver plenty to its people. Actually, shortages are endemic because of the inefficiencies inherent to command-and-control economies. The US embargo is unilateral, and the Cuban government has long been expert at evading it. There is nothing keeping Cuba from trading with other advanced Western countries and buying their goods, if the artificially impoverished country could afford them (its characteristic way of doing business is to buy on credit and then never pay up). All of this has always been plain enough, but now even more so. There is a revolutionary movement afoot in Cuba, one that is courageous, inspiring, and -- one hopes -- truly democratic. It is the ordinary people of Cuba attempting to vindicate their rights against the Lefts favorite dictatorship. Twitter: @RichLowry",

He said they traveled to Key West where they would hop on a ferry to enjoy the nightlife in Havana. ""Out of Key West, there were two or three ferry boats. You would drive your car right onto the ferry and when you got to Cuba you drove it off,"" LaNave said. ""Everybody went to the Tropicana. It was loaded with Americans and Europeans. Its was like Las Vegas."" Ad LaNave said he traveled to Cuba again when Americans were allowed back to the island. His friends had warned him the glitz had faded and the patina had turned into ruin. Still, he said he was shocked to see how empty the stores were. ""I saw the desperation in peoples faces,"" said LaNave, who has a practice as a life coach. LaNave said he met his Cuban friends relatives. He said he met an underpaid surgeon who was going to work on a bicycle and a physician who was hitchhiking to work.

Biden forced to pivot foreign policy focus to crises in neighboring nations,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/biden-foreign-policy-cuba-haiti/index.html,07/13/21,www.cnn.com,"(CNN) President Joe Biden has staked his presidency on America's return -- a return to normalcy amid the coronavirus pandemic , a return to the global stage following four years of Trump-era isolationism and, arguably, a return to many of the policy positions adopted by the Obama administration. But recent incidents in the Caribbean mark a moment in which the Biden administration may be in uncharted territory. While issues related to Russia, China and the Northern Triangle have been at the forefront of the Biden administration's foreign policy priorities, violence and demonstrations taking place just off of America's coast have forced the White House's response. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was killed during an attack last week on his private residence in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's first lady, Martine Moise, was also shot in the attack and evacuated to a hospital in Miami for treatment. The assassination has left the nation in deeper turmoil, leaving a power vacuum and coming as Haiti has been dealing with a wave of extreme violence, a growing humanitarian crisis and a worsening Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. The dual crises come at a time when the President would rather be focusing his attention on domestic issues like infrastructure and voting rights, a subject on which he's set to give a major speech on Tuesday. When it comes to foreign affairs the White House has been preoccupied with the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and resetting American foreign policy to focus on powers in the Eastern Hemisphere like Russia and China. To a certain extent, the dealings with those nations are ones that previous administrations also had to figure out how to handle, but the issues bubbling up in the Caribbean will be among the first unique foreign crises to test Biden and his team. Biden on Monday indicated that the US is ""ready to provide assistance"" to both Cuba and Haiti, but it's unclear exactly what form that help will take. The Haitian government last week requested US troops to help protect infrastructure, ports, airports and energy systems, Elections Minister Mathias Pierre told CNN. Mathias said the request was for a limited number of around 500 troops and that he anticipated the threat to be ""potential mercenaries."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that request is still under review. A US delegation traveled to Haiti on Sunday at the Haitian government's request and that delegation briefed Biden on Monday morning after their return. The State Department disclosed Monday that they are aware of a third American citizen detained in Haiti after the assassination. CNN reported Monday evening that several of the men involved in the operation that killed Moise previously worked as informants for US law enforcement, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, another complication for the US response. Psaki said the US is assessing how the country can directly aid the Cuban people. She said it is too early to predict any potential policy change when it comes to Cuba. So far, that has come in statements encouraging the Cuban regime to listen to the protesters and words of support for the people of Cuba. Biden expressed support for the Cuban people on Monday, calling on Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel's regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""Folks, I want to start recognizing remarkable protests taking place in Cuba,"" Biden said when speaking to reporters at the White House. ""I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- quite frankly, ever."" Biden said the Cuban people ""are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime,"" and asserting ""their universal rights."" He also warned the Cuban government against ""attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba."" But earlier this spring, Psaki indicated that Cuba was not among the administration's top policy priorities. ""A Cuba policy shift or additional steps is currently not among the President's top foreign policy priorities. But it is an issue, of course, we will remain engaged in and focused on,"" Psaki told reporters in April. Pressed on whether the weekend events in Cuba have changed the administration's priorities, Psaki said on Monday, ""We will be looking to provide support to the people of Cuba. We certainly, you know, support the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of -- when we believe they deserve to have access to the economic support and medical support, health supplies that many of them are asking for."" In nationally televised remarks Sunday, Diaz-Canel placed blame for the economic conditions on sanctions from the US. Under the Obama administration, Cuba oversaw the reopening of embassies and relaxing of many restrictions long in place since the embargo. But the Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, reinstated travel restrictions and before leaving office, named Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism The Biden administration has yet to take action, but the review of Trump's restrictive Cuba policy is still underway, a senior administration official tells CNN. Several months after taking office, Biden has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor's policies and ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Barack Obama. An administration official confirmed there are no changes on the horizon as the policy is still under review. Cuba's actions haven't exactly encouraged the administration to move quickly to change policy. The country has continued to support oppressive Latin American regimes and crackdown on dissidents. Brain injuries that have appeared to target Americans diplomats abroad have also included many originating in Cuba, leading to the name ""Havana Syndrome."" One major voice of opposition to returning to Obama-era Cuba policies is New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who told CNN he's offered a list of policy recommendations to the White House. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday why Biden had not yet taken action to lift the Trump policies on Cuba, Menendez said on ""The Lead,"" ""I think the President has had time to review the actual policies under President Obama and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided -- unilateral in terms of concessions -- showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba."" ""The regime enriched itself. The Cuban people never saw any benefit from it. So the result of that, I think, is that the Biden administration looked and said, 'Wait a minute -- that didn't seem to work. We have to think about what exactly we should do in this regard,' "" Menendez continued.",
Biden calls 'remarkable' Cuba protests a 'call for freedom',https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-government-and-politics-cuba-50bbf8e7591c6206783c993e57f62b5a,07/13/21,apnews.com,"President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting on reducing gun violence, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Monday, July 12, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting on reducing gun violence, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Monday, July 12, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden called protests in Cuba ""remarkable"" and a ""clarion call for freedom,"" praising thousands of Cubans who took the streets to protest food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis -- one of the islands biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. ""The Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. I dont think weve seen anything like this protest in a long long time, if, quite frankly, ever,"" Biden said Monday in a brief exchange with reporters at the start of a meeting with mayors and law enforcement officials to discuss gun violence in the U.S. ADVERTISEMENT The comments marked a notable change in tone from Bidens old boss, Barack Obama, who as president sought to ease decades of tensions between Washington and Havana while loosening U.S. imposed economic sanctions. It was an effort that was reversed by Republican President Donald Trump, who partially rolled back Obamas rapprochement, limiting U.S. travel to the island, banning American financial transactions with dozens of enterprises, and more. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in an earlier statement Monday. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights."" Julie Chung, the acting assistant secretary for the departments Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, on Sunday suggested that the protests were driven by Cuban people exercising ""their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID case/deaths & medicine shortage. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors."" But White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday sought to frame the protests being driven by far broader frustration, calling the demonstrations ""spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban governments economic mismanagement and repression."" Psaki added that the U.S. remains ready to assist Cuba in its COVID-19 vaccination effort, but the Cuban governments decision not to participate in COVAX -- a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to poorer nations -- complicated the effort. ADVERTISEMENT ""We certainly recognize and understand that access to vaccines is one of the issues that a number of individuals on the streets is voicing concern about, but we have to determine what the mechanism would be to work with the Cuban people to get vaccines to them,"" Psaki said. The scene of demonstrators on Havanas Malecon promenade and elsewhere on the island was an unusual scene as the communist leadership has historically shown little tolerance for criticism. Police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted ""Freedom,"" ""Enough"" and ""Unite."" One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., lashed out at Biden for taking a full day to acknowledge the protesters, noting on Twitter that Bidens statement did not describe the Cuba government as "" socialist and communist."" ""The protests in #Cuba began over 24 hours ago And you forgot something,"" Rubio said. Biden said on the campaign trail that he would largely reverse Trumps Cuba policy and return to Obama-era policies. But Biden has largely kept Trumps policies in the place in the early going. Rubio in a letter Monday called on the president to take a series of steps in support of the protesters, including making free satellite internet access available on the island; rallying Western Hemisphere and European Union leaders to condemn the Cuban governments efforts to stifle the voice of protesters; and making ""a clear and unambiguous statement that the current U.S. policies towards the regime implemented by the Trump Administration will remain in place."" Administration officials said their review of Cuba policy is ongoing. ""Were looking carefully and closely at what has just happened, what indeed is happening,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""And as we stated many times, at the heart of the review and at the heart of the policy that would result are democracy and human rights. Thats core to our efforts. That will be reflected in the policy.""",

(AP Photo/Ismael Francisco) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban authorities confirmed Tuesday that one person has died during demonstrations that have shaken the island in recent days by protesting over food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, 36, died Monday during a clash between protesters and police in the Arroyo Naranjo municipality on the outskirts of Havana. It said an unspecified number of people were arrested and there were some people injured, including some officers. The statement accused demonstrators of vandalizing houses, setting fires and damaging power lines. It also alleged they attacked police and civilians with knives, stones and other objects.. ADVERTISEMENT Demonstrations that erupted Sunday have seen thousands of Cubans in the streets voicing grievances against shortages of goods, rising prices and power cuts, and some protesters have called for a change of government. Havana still had a heavy police presence Tuesday, with officers particularly guarding key points such as the Malecon coastal promenade and the Capitol. Internet and cellphone data service continued to be disrupted. There were no reports of new protests, which the government has sought to blame on Cuban Americans using social media to instigate unrest in Cuba. The demonstrations in several cities and towns were some of the biggest displays of antigovernment sentiment seen in years in tightly controlled Cuba, which is facing a surge of coronavirus cases as it struggles with its worst economic crisis in decades as a consequence of U.S. sanctions imposed by President Donald Trumps administration. The rare outpouring of dissent led former President Raul Castro to join with other top leaders Monday to discuss the situation. ""On July 11, there were riots, there were disorders on a very limited scale, opportunistically taking advantage of the difficult conditions in which we Cubans are living today,"" Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Tuesday, adding that government experts had found evidence of outsiders using sophisticated equipment to widely broadcast alarmist and inciting messages over social media. But, Rodriguez said, ""On July 11, there was no social explosion in Cuba. There was not because of the will of our people and because of the support of our people for the revolution and its government."" Cubas Roman Catholic bishops issued a call to avoid violence. ADVERTISEMENT ""We understand that the government has responsibilities and has tried to take measures to alleviate the aforementioned difficulties, but we also understand that the people have the right to express their needs, desires and hopes,"" they said in a statement. The demonstrations were extremely unusual on an island where little dissent against the government is tolerated. The last major public demonstration of discontent, over economic hardship, took place nearly 30 years ago in 1994. Last year, there were small demonstrations by artists and other groups, but nothing as big or widespread as what erupted this past weekend. The U.S. has, so far at least, not detected any surge of migrants from Cuba, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. He also cautioned Cubans that any migrants intercepted at sea are returned to their homelands or sent to other countries under long-standing agreements intended to discourage people from trying to make the dangerous crossing. ""The humanitarian message to the people of Cuba is do not take to the seas,"" Mayorkas said. ""People die when they try to migrate in the maritime channel irregularly."" The issue of Cuban migration in opposition to the government resonates with Mayorkas, whose family fled the Cuban revolution in the 1960s. ""I understood what it meant for my father to lose everything that he had built for his young family,"" he said. ""We stand with the people of Cuba.""",

(Pedro Portal/Miami Herald via AP) MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators expressing solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who waged a rare weekend of protests around their island nation shut down a stretch of a major South Florida expressway Tuesday. The large group gathered at a busy Miami intersection chanting support for the Cubans, who had taken to the streets in the communist nation Sunday to air grievances about poor economic conditions and other complaints. A few miles (kilometers) away, hundreds of supporters gathered for hours Tuesday evening at a park. The peaceful crowd waved flags and cheered on the efforts of island protesters. ADVERTISEMENT Flavia Perez, 16, was brought to the U.S. at age 1. She joined the rally at Tamiami Park, saying, ""Im here to support young Cubans on the island so they have the same opportunities as I have in the U.S."" South Florida is home to the largest U.S. population of Cuban Americans. News helicopter footage from broadcaster WTVJ showed demonstrators earlier Tuesday marching to Miamis Palmetto Expressway, where many blocked traffic in the afternoon. Elsewhere, Floridas Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis held a round table with elected officials, including members of Congress. The gathering at Miamis American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora was closed to reporters, but the governor later asserted that protests in Cuba were more than just about shortages of vaccines, food and other basic items. ""They are revolting against a corrupt communist dictatorship that has ruled that island with an iron fist for over 60 years, that is responsible for death and destruction, not just on the island of Cuba but really throughout the Western Hemisphere,"" DeSantis said at a news conference. He said the demonstrators desire ""a free society."" Nationwide protests last year under the Black Lives Matter movement drew attention to racial injustice in the U.S. after the killings of Black people by police. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into Florida law a measure that enhances penalties against protestors who turn violent and allows criminal penalties against those who organize protests that turn violent. DeSantis dismissed similarities between Black Lives Matter and Tuesdays demonstrators. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" the governor said. He said the demonstrations in Miami were ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer."" DeSantis, who is said to be considering a run for the White House in 2024, declined a direct response when asked how Democratic President Joe Bidens administration should handle Cuba policy. But he said federal officials shouldnt be satisfied with small Cuban government accommodations designed to quell demonstrations. ADVERTISEMENT Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, the daughter of Cuban exiles, said the community needs to speak with one voice urging the Biden administration to stand tough against the Cuban government. ""We cannot negotiate with the regime at this hour,"" Salazar said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami has been monitoring for any ""unsafe and illegal"" crossings between Florida and Cuba in response to rare street protests on the island. Rear Adm. Eric C. Jones issued a warning statement Monday night as groups of Cuban immigrants said they planned to travel in boats filled with supplies to Cuba to show support for the Cuban protesters. In Miami, Cuban social media personalities posted Monday that they would make the 10-hour boat ride to Cuba to show support after rare street protests broke out over the weekend, the Miami Herald reported . The influencers said they would bring aid -- and guns -- and urged people in Miami to offer up their boats. One group gathered Monday night at a marina and people brought cases of bottled water, flashlights and boxes of canned pasta, the newspaper reported. ""Water, food, medicine, whatever we can take to Cuba. Whatever we can take to help is good,"" organizer Dennis Suayero told WSVN . The group didnt get very far Monday night. A message posted on organizer Santiago Riveras Instagram account early Tuesday said the Coast Guard stopped his group from traveling. Over the weekend, thousands of Cuban Americans gathered in Miamis Little Havana in support of Cuban street marches against high prices and food shortages on the island. Such unsanctioned protests are extremely rare, and Cuban police were out in force Monday to control them. The last such demonstrations in Havana took place in 1994. President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Cuban Americans of using social media to egg them on. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez , a Cuban American, tweeted that he has never ""felt such raw emotion from the people of Miami desperate for intervention by the government and by themselves on behalf of Cuba."" Miami wasnt the only Florida city where demonstrators gathered. For a second day, Cuban-Americans in Tampa gathered Tuesday at an intersection, blocking traffic and waving Cuban flags. Like the group in South Florida, Tampa demonstrators attempted to gain access to Interstate 275, but police held them back. Television images showed dozens of protesters in a city that traces its Cuban heritage back generations.

Biden's review of Trump's restrictive Cuba policies still underway,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/biden-cuba-review/index.html,07/13/21,www.cnn.com,"Several months after taking office, Biden has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor's policies and ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Barack Obama. The lack of action by the Biden administration on Cuba was highlighted this week after the communist-run island witnessed its largest protests in decades. An administration official confirmed there are no changes on the horizon as the policy is still under review. Biden promised in September 2020, during the campaign, that he would ""try to reverse the failed Trump policies that inflicted harm on Cubans and their families,"" but the review currently underway is unlikely to result in a return to the Obama-era policy of normalized relations with Havana, according to people familiar with the discussions. The thinking is that the Cuban government has shown no signs, in more than five years, of easing its political and economic repression of the Cuban people, which has severely narrowed the Biden administration's options for normalizing ties again -- especially given Biden's emphasis on human rights as a cornerstone of his foreign policy. Biden's team is also wary of the political implications of making concessions to Havana, as Obama did, without getting anything in return. ""Joe Biden is not Barack Obama in policy towards Cuba,"" Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the western hemisphere, told Andres Oppenheimer in April. ""The political moment has changed in an important way, the political space has closed a lot, because the Cuban government has not responded in any way, and in fact the oppression against Cubans is even worse today than perhaps it was during the Bush administration."" Gonzalez added that ""human rights will be a key factor in any conversation that we may have with the regime."" To that end, Biden's team has focused on incremental steps like easing restrictions on remittances that Americans can send to relatives on the island -- which were all but banned under Trump -- and potentially opening up travel again as a way to expose Cubans to American ideals. Other forms of more immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people are also being weighed, as the administration tries to find ways to ""let some of the air out of the pressure cooker"" and defuse the situation before it becomes violent, said one person familiar with the thinking. A second senior administration official said the administration has ""been reviewing our Cuba policy with an eye towards its impact on the political and economic well-being of the Cuban people. Democracy and human rights are central to that assessment."" This official added that ""we are watching the Cuban government's response to the protests very closely, and call on them to refrain from violence and repression against peaceful protesters; and to serve their people rather than enrich themselves."" A congressional aide said discussions have been underway with the administration about opening lines of communication with Cuban protesters and with members of the Cuban military to try to defuse the situation, and to build a coalition of international allies who can send a united message that there will be repercussions if the government reacts violently to the protests. There have also been discussions about how the US can help restore and expand internet access to Cubans, as the regime continues its blackouts, the aide said. ""The Biden administration has been consistent in its calls for the promotion of democracy and human rights in Cuba,"" the second senior administration official said, ""including denouncing abuses by Cuba's authoritarian regime and pushing for reforms. This is not new."" Juan Cruz, who served as NSC senior director for the western hemisphere under Trump, said the US risks getting ""beat over the head by the Cubans"" if it rushes to return to the Obama-era policies amid the protests. There are hopes by some in the administration that this new wave of dissent could create a split within the regime that the US could then capitalize on, Cruz said. But American involvement could backfire and exacerbate tensions even further. ""This is not going to be a 'Cuban spring,'"" he said. ""The administration is not going to go back to the Obama era on this."" Whether Biden will ultimately follow through on his campaign promises remains to be seen. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is a strong opponent of Obama's policies and the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, hinted Monday that he thinks Biden may not. ""I think the President has had a time to review the actual policies under President Obama and all of the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided, unilateral in terms of concessions, showed themselves to create absolutely no change inside of Cuba,"" Menendez told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""So the result of that, I think, is the Biden administration looked and said, 'Wait a minute. That didn't seem to work.'"" On Monday, Menendez and Biden spoke during a brief phone call, according to an official. Biden also told reporters he would talk more publicly about the ongoing crises in Cuba and Haiti later this week. A senior official says he has no formal speech planned but he will likely discuss it more as the US gathers intelligence. How Biden navigates Cuba could carry political implications, given he lost Florida to Trump in the 2020 election after the former President repeatedly claimed Biden would turn the US into a ""socialist country"" if he won, a message that resonated with Cuban Americans. While changing Cuba policy was not among his ""top foreign policy priorities,"" according to top aides, the recent protests have sparked fresh conversations about it inside the West Wing. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets this weekend to protest a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. ""I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- quite frankly, ever,"" Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday. The President said the US ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights,"" and said the Cuban people ""are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime."" He called on the Cuban government to ""refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba."" Biden also told reporters at the White House on Monday that his team was closely monitoring the developments in Haiti in the wake of the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise. He was killed last week on his private residence in the capital of Port-au-Prince, and Haiti's first lady, Martine Moise, was also shot in the attack and evacuated to a hospital in Miami for treatment. Biden on Monday indicated that the US is ""ready to provide assistance"" to both Cuba and Haiti, but it is unclear what form that will take.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remained silent as of early Tuesday about violent protests erupting in Cuba, while Sen. Bernie Sanders finally spoke out -- to blame US sanctions rather than decades of Communist dictatorship. ""All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society,"" Sanders tweeted just before midnight Monday of the protests that started Sunday demanding ""freedom"" and the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. ""I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence,"" the democratic socialist implored of the leader who had called for ""revolutionaries"" to take to the streets and fight for communism. ""Its also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people,"" Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote. Protests in Cuba began Sunday demanding freedom and the removal of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. AFP via Getty Images His message received backlash from many who suggested he was missing the clear message being sent by protesters demanding freedom from the nations rulers -- with viral images also showing some carrying American flags as a symbol of the democracy they sought. Sen. Bernie Sanders called for an end to the US embargo on Cuba, saying it has ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" AFP via Getty Images ""You want to help?

AFP via Getty Images Others noted just how long it had taken the democratic socialist to speak up. ""He needed 72 hours to wrap his head around it,"" economist and conservative blogger Max Murray quipped. Still, Sanders had done more than other progressive Democratic leaders, with critics noting the ongoing silence of the partys usually outspoken progressive ""Squad"" members. Protesters marched through Cuba chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty."" AFP via Getty Images Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was active on Twitter until late Monday -- ripping white supremacy, without any mention of Cuba. Other outspoken ""Squad"" members like Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) also appear to have ignored the protests. Fox Business host Stuart Varney had insisted in his show that the ""silence from Americas left"" was because the protests were highlighting ""the failure of socialism."" ""The far left want to make America more like Cuba. But a lot of Cubans apparently want to be more like Americans,"" Varney said.",
"Bloody Monday in Cuba: Hundreds Likely Missing, Police Fire into Crowds",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/bloody-monday-cuba-hundreds-likely-missing-police-fire-crowds-protesters/,07/13/21,www.breitbart.com,"A near-nationwide internet blackout severely limited the ability of protesters to share updates and images from Cuba, but the little that has trickled out suggests the island experienced another wave of thousands-strong protests on Monday that has triggered severe communist repression. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets of nearly every major city in the country on Sunday, peacefully assembling to demand an end to communism. Protesters shared videos of crowds marching peacefully on Havanas iconic Malecon and throughout major cities like Camaguey, Cardenas, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba, some of them waving American flags and others sporting Catholic and other Christian imagery in defiance of the officially atheist Communist Party. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the Castro regime, responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to violently assault unarmed protesters on the streets, describing his call as an ""order of combat."" In response to Diaz-Canels call, both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers have unleashed a wave of repression on protesters that has included shooting at them, attacking them with dogs, and public beatings. The beatings have not been limited to protesters -- among the most gruesome images surfacing on Sunday was that of the bloody face of Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa, beaten publicly by a gang of uniformed police officers for attempting to do his job. The Castro regime appeared to shut down internet access throughout most of the island Monday, limiting the previously extensive flow of citizen journalist videos depicting extreme repression. Reports nonetheless trickled out that appeared to indicate hundreds of people are missing nationwide and families have not been able to see their relatives who have been hospitalized with bullet injuries. Witnesses say police stations have also attracted crowds of loved ones seeking information on the missing to no avail. By early Monday, human rights groups had managed to confirm the arrest or disappearance of 57 people, most of them prominent dissidents with ties to civil society organizations that could document their disappearance. Most observers considered the number significantly lower than the probably true total of arrests and disappearances, citing witness reports of overwhelmed police stations, prisons, and hospitals. On Monday evening, Erika Guevara-Rosas, the Americas director at Amnesty International, shared that the list of confirmed arrests, not counting disappearances, had risen to 115 people in the country. Hasta el momento se reporta la detencion arbitraria de por lo menos 115 personas en el contexto de las protestas, entre ellas, se han detenido ayer y hoy, a periodistas independientes, que valientemente han informando sobre los acontecimientos en #Cuba. Exigimos su liberacion. https://t.co/9rvlLNc989 -- Erika Guevara-Rosas (@ErikaGuevaraR) July 12, 2021 The internet shutdown and police repression have succeeded, in part, in silencing protesters, leading many on the island to reach out anonymously with information on the ground that international establishment media have not bothered to confirm and those outside the island do not have the resources to. In one message circulating in Miami-based media, an unnamed Cuban source describes police stations in major cities as surrounded by crowds of people demanding to know where the missing are. Another report alleged that desperate family members surrounded a police station in Capri, a Havana neighborhood, and attempted to storm it and burn it down; that report remains unverified. Hospitals in the country, already overwhelmed by coronavirus patients, are full of people injured by police, the message continued, but police officials have allegedly cut off access to any patients with bullet injuries or other conditions that indicate they were present at the protests. The few videos that Cubans have managed to smuggle out of the country, and media outlets have been able to verify as authentic and from the protests this week, indicate that the Castro regime has launched a nationwide campaign of violence against anyone calling for its end. In one video shared by the dissident outlet Cubanet -- which lost several reporters to police arrests on Sunday -- a mob of communists carrying baseball bats and large sticks can be seen approaching and assaulting peaceful protesters. Another video published and verified by Cubanet, appearing to be from Santiago de Cuba, shows a protester bleeding out on the street of an apparent gunshot wound in the head. The man appears unconscious and is bleeding profusely from the head as civilians surround him and attempt to wrap his head with cloth to stop the bleeding. ""They killed him, they killed him!"" onlookers shout. Warning: Graphic Video Cubanet reported large protests on Monday in Havana and Holguin, where protesters reportedly surrounded the headquarters of the local chapter of the Communist Party of Cuba. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights published a video Tuesday of unnamed health workers confirming another death at the hands of police. The health workers say a colleague protesting peacefully was ""beaten to death"" in broad daylight; the human rights group does not supply information regarding where on the island the incident reportedly happened.

""They took his teeth out, they threw the dogs at him, seven, eight black berets [state security officers] beat him,"" the woman said. ""While the children of the henchmen you people defend are in other countries, yours are here and they will pay,"" she added, apparently addressing the police officers allegedly responsible for the killing. 14 y Medio reportedly multiple eyewitness accounts that share a detail with the Mayabeque death: the use of police dogs to terrorize protesters. Cuban journalist Jose Raul Gallego reportedly told the outlet that police executed raids throughout the night of Sunday and early morning Monday, going door-to-door with police dogs and abducting people. Unverified videos surfacing on Facebook appear to show police dragging minors suspected of having participated in peaceful protests out of their homes. In Camaguey, the outlet added, reports suggest as many as 2,000 people injured. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
"Joe Biden Lifts Sanctions on Venezuela, Giving Cuba a Lifeline",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/13/biden-lifts-sanctions-venezuela-giving-cuba-lifeline/,07/13/21,www.breitbart.com,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Monday lifted sanctions on the export of gas to socialist Venezuela, a boon to the dictatorship in Caracas and its patron government in communist Cuba, which struggles to suppress mounting opposition and calls for the regimes total abolition. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued a general license number 40, permitting ""all transactions and activities related to the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of liquefied petroleum gas to Venezuela"" as well as the socialist regimes state-owned affiliates, specifically rescinding restrictions that then-President Donald Trump imposed via three executive orders in 2018 and 2019. The license remains valid through July 8, 2022. Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the state-owned company managing the nations (and some of the worlds) largest oil reserves, fell under socialist control in 1998, when Hugo Chavez nationalized the entity. With socialist cronies in charge, Venezuelas oil production began to decline at a rapid rate, falling to levels not seen since 1947 by mid-2020. Despite abundant supply, the mismanagement is so great the nation routinely experiences severe gasoline shortages. OFAC left intact sanctions on individual Venezuelan government officials, many of whom allegedly maintain ties with drug cartels, human trafficking organizations, or terrorist cells. Television star Diosdado Cabello, the first vice president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela PSUV) and Maduros second-in-command, has for years been identified as a major figure in the international drug trade, with informants naming him as the leader of the Cartel de los Soles. The group, run out of the Venezuelan military, operates an international cocaine ring. Formerly the richest nation in Latin America - following the decline of previously richest nation Cuba under communism - due to its vast oil reserves, years of socialist mismanagement have driven the Venezuelan economy into the ground. Inflation in particular has annihilated citizens personal wealth and forced a majority of Venezuelans to eschew the local currency in favor of foreign bills will stable value. A 2020 study revealed that a majority of transactions in Venezuela occurred using the U.S. dollar as a medium. The economy has deteriorated to the extent that citizens have resorted to scavenging food from street trash to avoid starvation. In lieu of stable healthcare infrastructure, Venezuelans have had to improvise means of tending to their sick and injured, with one viral video depicting locals using the back of a garbage truck as an ambulance. The easing of economic restrictions against Caracas will likely provide an economic boost to the socialist dictatorship under Nicolas Maduro, which has maintained power illegally through the military since the expiration of his last legitimate term in 2019. By extension, Cuba -- the regimes de facto colonial overlord -- will secure a much-needed economic windfall amid its struggles to contain both the Chinese coronavirus and a wave of democratic protests. Havana has effectively run Venezuela for years. Maduro defectors and foreign relations experts have reported that the country relies heavily on nearly 100,000 Cuban communist agents to manage the national ""revolution"" since at least 2010. Reports further indicate that Cuba uses its colony as a staging ground for its drug trafficking operations and as a meeting place for its allied terrorist groups like the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization. Caracas has further served as an economic lifeline for Havana, supplying much of the regimes energy needs on credit, with extremely lenient terms. Director of Petroleum for Venezuela Francisco Rodriguez asserted in 2020 that Cuba owed over $11 billion to Venezuela, with a doubtful prospect for repayment. Beginning Sunday, thousands of Cubans took to the streets of at least 20 cities, demanding an end to communism on the island. Originating in San Antonio de los Banos, protesters shouted ""Down with communism!"" and "" fuck Diaz-Canel!"" referencing the nations puppet president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, whom Raul Castro appointed to be the regimes public face. The ""president"" has since called for communists to violently confront the demonstrators and overseen a brutal police crackdown. As of Monday, at least 57 dissidents, including Roman Catholic priests, street artists, and peace activists have been confirmed to be in police custody.",

Cuba: 90-Year-Old Raul Castro Resurfaces to Silence Protests,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/cuba-90-year-old-raul-castro-resurfaces-to-silence-protests/,07/13/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Communist Party of Cuba trotted out 90-year-old Raul Castro - the nations ultimate leader despite his official retirement - on Monday, claiming he participated in a Politburo meeting on the protests hitting the island on Sunday. Cubans in at least 20 localities around the island organized peaceful manifestations on Sunday believed to have attracted thousands of people. Many marched chanting ""freedom!"" and slogans in opposition to communism. The immediate response from the Communist Party was violence; Cubans have uploaded multiple videos to social media appearing to show police officers opening fire on crowds of protesters, beating them with batons on the streets, and arresting and disappearing participants in the protests. Manifestations continued throughout Monday but the regime shut down access to the internet nearly across the country, preventing Cubans from sharing breaking news from the island outside of encrypted messages and some isolated images. The official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and state television claimed that Castro participated in the meeting alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who Castro hand-picked to be the face of the Party. Cuba experts consider Castro and his extended family the ultimate bosses in Cuba, however, as many hold high-ranking military and Party positions and Raul Castro himself still resurfaces for events the Party deems important enough. Granma did not describe the meeting as an ""emergency"" gathering but gave the impression that it was an urgent attempt to organize a response to the protests. The meeting reportedly occurred on Sunday, but was the lead story on Granma's online homepage on Tuesday morning. ""During the meeting, the provocations orchestrated by counterrevolutionary elements, organized and financed from the United States with destabilizing purposes, were analyzed,"" Granma reported. Granma offered no other information. It published no images that would prove that the nonagenarian dictator was present at the meeting. While its front-page headline promised video content, the video was a news report by communist media featuring only an anchor sitting at a desk and reporting that the meeting had occurred. Prominently advertising Castros involvement in decisionmaking surrounding the protests appears to be a response to the outsized attention the protests have given Diaz-Canel. A longtime Communist Party lackey, Diaz-Canel first became president of the country in 2018. The Cuban constitution states that the president of the country is outranked by the Chairman of the Communist Party of Cuba and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Castro held all three titles before giving Diaz-Canel the presidency, remaining his boss. At the time, Diaz-Canel promised Castro would ""preside over all major decisions for the present and future of the nation."" Castro claimed to have retired in April 2021, giving Diaz-Canel the title of chairman of the Party. His public return indicates, however, that Diaz-Canel still lacks ultimate authority in the country. Protests continued - and, reportedly, intensified - on Monday. The few images surfacing show severely injured unarmed protesters. One video appeared to show an unconscious man bleeding to death on the street while bystanders attempting to wrap the gunshot wound in his head with cloth to save him. Amnesty International has confirmed 115 arrests as of Tuesday, many of them of prominent members of the Cuban dissident community who have been subject to routine arbitrary detentions for decades. Cubalex, an independent human rights group, documented over 150 people either missing or in police custody without being accused of a crime as of Tuesday and continues to update its database in real time. The U.S.-based Marti News reported on Tuesday that the Communist Party had deployed motorized gangs to attack the protests - a staple repressive tactic of Cubas colony, Venezuela. The violence followed a direct order from Diaz-Canel, issued in a televised speech, late on Sunday to ""revolutionaries"" to take the streets and attack peaceful protesters. Diaz-Canel called it an ""order of combat"" against ""counterrevolutionaries"" and explicitly urged violence. On Monday, Diaz-Canel posted another call to violence on Twitter. ""The Cuban Revolution will not turn the other cheek to those who attack it, in both virtual and real-life spaces,"" Diaz-Canel wrote, an apparent rebuke of Christian doctrine. The Communist Party is explicitly atheist and has regularly persecuted Christians of all denominations since 1959. The Castro regime actively persecuted Christians in the 1960s by placing them in the Military Units to Aid Production (UMAP), labor camps for ""undesirables"" and ""counterrevolutionaries."" Several of those arrested and beaten on Sunday and Monday are members of Christian clergy. ""Let us avoid revolutionary violence but we will repress counterrevolutionary violence,"" Diaz-Canels statement on Twitter continued. ""Whoever attacks the agents of order attacks the country."" Despite the call to ""repression,"" Diaz-Canels tweet remains available on that platform at press time. La #RevolucionCubana no va a poner la otra mejilla a quienes la atacan en espacios virtuales y reales. Evitaremos la violencia revolucionaria, pero reprimiremos la violencia contrarrevolucionaria. Quien ataca a los agentes del orden ataca al pais #SomosCuba pic.twitter.com/7lLPk30wcV -- Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez (@DiazCanelB) July 12, 2021 Granma reported on Monday that, following the Politburo meeting and call to violence, Diaz-Canel held a Party meeting on Monday to discuss several unrelated topics, apparently ignoring the protests. Among them was the failing Cuban power grid and its fully collapsed socialist healthcare system. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
One reported dead in anti-government protests in Cuba,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/americas/cuba-protests-100-detained-missing-intl/index.html,07/13/21,www.cnn.com,"Havana, Cuba and Madrid, Spain (CNN) Anti-government activists in Cuba say that more than 100 people have been arrested or are missing on the island following widespread protests on Sunday. One person died during clashes with police on Monday, Cuba's Ministry of Interior said Tuesday, according to state-run Radio Rebelde. The Movimiento San Isidro, which advocates for greater artistic expression in Cuba, published a list of activists that it said were believed to have been detained by authorities. Among the detainees is journalist Camila Acosta, according to Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares, who called for her release. The Interior Ministry said the man who died and other protesters had attacked officials. On Sunday, CNN journalists witnessed multiple people being forcibly arrested and thrown in the back of vans at protests in Havana. Videos of the protest showed demonstrators turning over a police car and throwing rocks at officers. The Cuban government has not said how many people were arrested or injured in the disturbances. A police car is overturned during a demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 11. These are the largest protests on the island in decades, as Cubans complained about a lack of food and medicine as the country undergoes a grave economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and US sanctions. In San Antonio de los Banos, a city of about 46,000 people to the west of Havana, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday, fed up after nearly a week of electricity cuts during the sweltering July heat. ""Everyone was in the streets,"" one resident, who did not want to be named, told CNN. ""They have gone six days with only 12 hours of power each day. That was one of the things that blew this up."" On Wednesday night, the Cuban government announced it would lift restrictions on travelers bringing in food, medicine and hygiene products. Custom duties on these products will not need to be paid, and the relaxed measures will stay in place for the rest of the year. Diaz-Canel had previously blamed US trade sanctions for the communist-run island's economic woes in a nationally televised address, and urged his supporters to physically confront the protesters. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance on Sunday. ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets."" He denied police had used excessive force -- but days later, acknowledged the government needed to do more outreach and improve conditions in poor neighborhoods that had been rocked by the protests. He said he didn't know the exact figure, but estimated ""tens of people"" had been injured in the protests. President Miguel Diaz-Canel (in dark blue shirt, wearing a mask) walks with supporters Sunday after an anti-government protest in San Antonio de los Banos, Cuba. The government also held a meeting on Sunday to discuss the protests, according to state media. It was attended by high-ranking members including former President and Communist Party head Raul Castro, the brother of former President Fidel Castro. Castro retired his last leadership role in April before turning over power to his handpicked successor Diaz-Canel. At the time, Diaz-Canel said Castro would be consulted on all major issues impacting the island. Journalist detained Acosta, the detained journalist, writes for the ABC newspaper in Madrid, the Spanish capital. ABC reported that she was arrested on Monday morning in Havana as she left her home. Later, Cuban security agents searched her home and took her computer, it said. Hours earlier, she had reported on anti-government demonstrations in the Cuban capital on Sunday. This is not the first time that Acosta has had a run-in with Cuban authorities for doing her job as a reporter, ABC said. The newspaper said that her arrest is ""completely unacceptable."" It also called for Acosta's ""immediate release and the return of all professional material taken from her home,"" as well as the dropping of the charges against her for alleged crimes against Cuban state security. An editor at ABC confirmed to CNN that Acosta is a Cuban national and had been working at the paper for around six months. Cubans gather outside the Capitol to demonstrate against the government of President Miguel Diaz-Canel on July 11. Spain's Foreign Minister Albares called for her immediate release in a tweet, saying that, ""Spain defends the right to free and peaceful demonstrations and asks the Cuban authorities to respect that. We defend human rights."" US President Joe Biden has warned the Cuban government not to crack down on its newly defiant citizens. But on Monday, at another lengthy televised government meeting, Diaz-Canel said the protesters were criminals. ""They stoned the police force, damaged cars,"" he said. ""A behavior that's completely vulgar, completely indecent."" Cuban government officials on Monday said there had been no more protests as they enacted an internet blackout. This prevented Cubans from sharing images of demonstrations that had gathered momentum behind the protests in the first place. Meanwhile, US-Cuban relations are at their lowest point in years. The Trump administration enacted some of the toughest economic measures against Cuba in decades, and so far, the Biden administration seems reluctant to lift them. Biden's review of Trump's policy is still underway, an administration official confirmed. Several months after taking office, he has yet to fulfill his campaign pledge to ""go back"" to the full diplomatic relations put in place by former President Obama. Whether Biden will ultimately follow through remains to be seen. Sen. Menendez, a strong opponent of Obama's policies and the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, hinted Monday that he thinks Biden might not, after reviewing ""all the openings that President Obama made, which were one-sided, unilateral in terms of concessions."" US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Tuesday called on the Cuban government to show restraint and stop its internet blackout. In Miami, the center of the Cuban exile community in the United States, protesters have taken to the streets in support of the anti-government demonstrators. On Tuesday, parts of the Palmetto Expressway was shut down by protesters, according to Lt. Alex Camacho of the Florida Highway Patrol. The US Coast Guard has issued a statement urging Cubans on the island ""to not take to the sea,"" noting the ""dangerous and unforgiving"" transit across the Florida Straits has claimed nearly 20 lives in recent weeks, according to Rear Adm. Eric Jones, commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District in Miami. The already struggling Cuban economy has been hit hard as tourism and good imports have dropped steeply during the pandemic. On Sunday, Cuban health officials also reported a record single-day increase for new Covid-19 cases and deaths. On Monday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador joined Cuban officials in calling for the US to suspend the Cuba trade embargo as a humanitarian gesture. ""No country in the world should be fenced in, blockaded -- that's the opposite of human rights,"" he said. When asked why Biden had not yet reversed Trump's policies towards Cuba, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday the US had continued to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies, but added, ""I have nothing to preview for you in terms of a change of policy."" And US Secretary of State Tony Blinken has pushed back against criticism from the Cuban government, saying ""it would be a grievous mistake for the Cuban regime to interpret what is happening in dozens of towns and cities across the island as the result or product of anything the United States has done."" ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" Blinken said.

Cuba protests: one man killed and more than 100 missing in historic unrest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/13/cuba-protests-activists-journalists-protesters-detained,07/13/21,www.theguardian.com,"One person has died during demonstrations in Cuba over food shortages, high prices and other grievances against the government. The interior ministry said on Tuesday that Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, 36, died during a clash on Monday between protesters and police in the Arroyo Naranjo municipality on the outskirts of Havana. It said an unspecified number of people were arrested and there were some people injured, including some officers. The statement accused demonstrators of vandalising houses, setting fires and damaging power lines. It also alleged they attacked police and civilians with knives, stones and other objects. The confirmation follows reports that scores of activists, protesters and journalists, including a reporter for one of Spains leading newspapers, have been detained as Communist party security forces seek to smother Sundays historic flare-up of dissent. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty Internationals Americas director, said at least 140 Cubans were believed to have been detained or had disappeared in the aftermath of Cubas largest demonstrations in decades. ""The idea is to punish those who dare to challenge the government ... and send a message"" that no further protests would be tolerated, said Guevara-Rosas, who said spontaneous and peaceful rallies had taken place in at least 48 separate locations, including Havana. On Tuesday Spains foreign minister, Jose Manuel Albares, demanded the immediate release of Camila Acosta, a Cuban journalist who reports for a Spanish newspaper and was among those seized from their homes in the capital early on Monday. ""Spain defends the right to demonstrate freely and peacefully and asks the Cuban authorities to respect it. We unconditionally defend human rights,"" Albares said on Twitter amid reports that Acosta, who reports for the conservative ABC paper, would be charged with crimes against state security. Earlier this month the group Reporters Without Borders named the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, as one of the ""press freedom predators"" of 2021, alongside Nicaraguas authoritarian leader, Daniel Ortega, and Brazils far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and called Cuba ""Latin Americas worst media freedom violator"". On Monday Diaz-Canel painted the protests - which erupted as Cuba faces a severe economic crunch exacerbated by US sanctions and a Covid pandemic that has shattered the islands tourist industry - as part of a foreign plot to ""fracture"" the communist revolution launched by Fidel Castro in 1959. A special forces vehicle patrols downtown Havana on Monday. Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters Carolina Barrero, a Havana-based activist, said the wave of detentions were intended ""to erase"" Sundays demonstrations and ensure there was no repeat. ""[This] is a dictatorship - this is what they do,"" Barrero said from her home in Havana, where she has been under house arrest since June. Guevara-Rosas said internet shutdowns meant it was hard to verify the precise scale of the crackdown on demonstrators, who had been protesting against shortages of food and medicine as well as one-party rule. But targets appeared to include prominent human rights campaigners, independent journalists and one of the leaders of the Movimiento San Isidro, a collective of artists and activists that has been pushing for greater political freedoms. Marta Maria Ramirez, 46, a feminist and LGBT activist, said she knew dozens of people who had been arrested, among them Gretel Medina, a young film director who is breastfeeding her baby son. ""Im very sad about the violent response from authorities,"" Ramirez said. ""Police are repressive everywhere. But thats not whats proclaimed here - in Cuba they are supposed to be an organ of the people, they are supposed to protect the people."" On Monday, Joe Biden called on Cuban authorities to respect citizens rights, ""including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future"". In a televised broadcast Cubas foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, hit back, attacking the ""extraordinary cynicism and hypocrisy"" of US politicians. Rodriguez urged the US president to stop the ""brutal repression"" that US police forces inflict on African Americans and journalists. Rodriguez also slammed Bolsonaro after he accused Cuba of ""massacring"" its peoples freedoms. ""Brazils president should sort out his performance which has contributed to the deplorable death of hundreds of thousands of Brazilians from Covid ... and worry about the acts of corruption he is involved in rather than seeking to distract attention by casting a superficial eye on Cuba,"" Rodriguez tweeted. Albares, who was appointed foreign minister in Spains Socialist-led coalition government over the weekend, stopped short of condemning recent events in Cuba. In a statement released on Tuesday morning, his ministry urged Cuban authorities to ""speed up the pace of reform"" to help the island address the economic crisis and the lack of tourist revenues due to the Covid pandemic. Cuban exiles in Miami announced seemingly half-baked plans to make the 10-hour boat journey from Florida to Cuba on Monday to offer the protesters supplies, support and perhaps even guns. The US coast guard indicated it was unlikely to allow flotillas to undertake the ""dangerous and unforgiving"" journey across the Florida straits and was monitoring attempts to make ""unsafe and illegal"" crossings.",

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Tuesday that those fleeing Cuba or Haiti by sea would not be allowed into the U.S. -- and would either be returned or, if they were found to have a fear of persecution, referred to a third country. ""The time is never right to attempt migration by sea,"" Mayorkas said at a press conference. ""To those who risk their lives doing so, this risk is not worth taking."" DEMONSTRATIONS ERUPT ACROSS FLORIDA IN SUPPORT OF CUBAN PEOPLE, CALL FOR END OF COMMUNIST REGIME ""Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" he said.

Univision: Cuba 'Not a Priority' for Joe Biden,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/univision-cuba-not-priority-joe-biden/,07/13/21,www.breitbart.com,"A Univision report Monday on President Joe Bidens tepid response to the ongoing protests against communism in Cuba accused Biden of having little interest in the topic, noting his administration ""openly admitted"" to not prioritizing the island. Univisions report focused on the outpouring of support from Cuban-Americans and others within the United States for the protests in the country, which began on Sunday and attracted thousands of people to every major city on the island. Journalists managed to document protests in at least 20 municipalities nationwide stretching from far-west Pinar del Rio to Santiago de Cuba, the eastern capital of Oriente province. The marches, the largest wave of a movement against communism that has organized weekly protests for nearly two decades, featured protesters walking peacefully chanting slogans against the 62-year-old communist regime. ""Freedom!"" was a common chant nationwide, as well insults against Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead ""president"" of the Castro regime. Some protesters also waved American flags or wore clothes emblazoned with the symbol of freedom. Diaz-Canel responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to take the streets and violently assault unarmed protesters in a speech on Sunday. Cuban authorities blocked access to the internet nearly nationwide, preventing the deluge of violent imagery that surfaced on Sunday from repeating on Monday. As of Tuesday, however, Cubans are slowly starting to find ways to share footage of the island, revealing egregious human rights abuses on the part of the Communist Party like public beatings and police shooting dissidents dead in broad daylight. Univision initially spoke to a group of Cuban-American protesters in Washington, D.C., who said they sought ""urgent military interventions"" to save their loved ones. The report noted that such support is unlikely, though Biden issued a statement nominally extending support to the Cuban people. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" Bidens statement read in part. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" The statement notably omitted the fact that Cubas regime is communist, that the protesters actively chanted slogans against communism and socialism, and reframed the protests as being about ""economic suffering."" Bidens only concrete move on Cuba on Monday was the lifting of sanctions on Venezuelas oil industry. Venezuela is a colony state of Cubas, largely run by Cuban state security agents, and the Communist regime has largely subsisted on Venezuelan oil in the aftermath of the rise of socialist dictator Hugo Chavez. ""Despite the support that President Biden is offering to the people of Cuba today, this White House has openly admitted that the issue of the island is not a priority for this government,"" Univision White House correspondent noted in the report, as documented by the Media Research Center: DEVASTATING close to today's @UniNoticias reporting on #SOSCubaLibre by @janrodrigueztv: ""...this WH has openly admitted that the (Cuban) issue is not a priority for this Administration"". pic.twitter.com/4NZMJ1WC7G -- Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) July 12, 2021 Rodriguez added in a note on her Twitter account a quote from White House press secretary Jen Psaki stating, ""I cant saw at what priority level Cuba is in."" Elsewhere in Mondays press conference, Psaki made the bizarre claim that Cubans chanting the word ""freedom"" were actually demanding ""freedom from COVID"" [Chinese coronavirus]. Rodriguez noted Psaki had previously dismissed Cuba as not a priority at all. ""A Cuba policy shift is not currently among President Bidens top priorities,"" Psaki told reporters in March. As a presidential candidate last year, Biden attacked President Donald Trump on multiple occasions for his anti-communist policies, particularly increased sanctions on human rights violators on the island and support for the Cuban exile community at home. Trump also restored Cuba to the State Departments State Sponsors of Terrorism list in response to Havanas support of Marxist terrorist groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Islamist groups like Hezbollah. Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama, who all but eliminated the Cuban embargo, leading to record levels of repression of peaceful dissidents. ""The administrations approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago,"" Biden said in October 2020. Biden promised to help ""empower the Cuban people to determine their own future,"" without elaborating. In practice, Biden has taken no significant action on Cuba, meaning the Trump policies largely remain in place. A significant number of political observers note the scale of the protests erupting this week is much larger than the usual protests and the regime appears unable to quell them, suggesting Cuba may be closer to freedom as a result of Trumps policies than it was before the policies were implemented. Protests reportedly continued on the island on Tuesday. Most of the information currently leaving the country is from its largest cities -- Havana and Santiago -- but limited communication between Cubans on the island and those in the United States suggests that Camaguey, Mayabeque, Holguin, and other central areas also remain nodes of unrest.",

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday told any migrants fleeing unrest in Cuba: ""Let me be clear: If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States."" But Cuban migrants are largely flocking to the U.S.-Mexico land border, not the U.S. coast. And in a sharp break from his predecessor Donald Trump, President Joe Biden has been letting most in pending the outcome of their asylum applications, according to government data. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Since Biden took office in late January, the number of Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has risen sharply. This fiscal year through May, which began in October, border officials encountered more than 22,000 Cubans, the highest level in more than a decade. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows vividly the sharp contrast between the approaches of the Trump and Biden administration toward Cuban migrants. In December 2020 - the last full month of Trump's presidency - nearly two-thirds of all Cubans caught crossing the border were expelled to Mexico under a pandemic-related health order known as Title 42. By May of this year, the last month data is available, around 96% of Cubans were allowed into the United States to reunite with U.S.-based family members and seek legal status in immigration court. The majority of Cuban migrants being allowed in are single adults, a notable development because Biden has continued to expel the vast majority of individual adults arriving from Central America and Mexico. He has made exceptions only for unaccompanied minors and most families. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. UNREST ON THE ISLAND In Cuba, thousands have joined recent protests in cities across the nation amid frustrations with widespread shortages of basic goods including medicine, power outages, rising prices and a surge in COVID-19 cases. Some demonstrators also called for political change. The Cuban government has blamed the shortages on U.S. sanctions and says the United States has backed the opposition. read more It is not yet clear whether the unrest could lead to even more people trying to flee the island. Mayorkas said in his press briefing that the United States has not seen an uptick in migration via sea. ""Any migrant intercepted at sea, regardless of their nationality, will not be permitted to enter the United States,"" Mayorkas said. ""This risk is not worth taking."" He said 20 people have died in recent weeks during these voyages.  The U.S. Coast Guard recently sent two cutter boats to back up others in nearby waters off the coast of Haiti, which is also experiencing a political crisis following the assassination of its president. ""Our priority is to preserve and save lives,"" Mayorkas said. U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio voiced concerns this week an explosion in anti-government protests in Cuba could spark a return to the era of massive boatlifts of Cubans seeking refuge at U.S. shores. Rubio, a Cuban-American representing Florida, raised the specter of the iconic Mariel boatlift in the 1980s and a 1994 surge in rafts leaving the island, saying on Twitter that the Cuban government could use the protests as an excuse to lift travel restrictions and spark another crisis at sea. Pedro Ruiz, 51, who said he had to flee Cuba in 2016 because of his involvement in an opposition political party, encountered the stark difference between Trump and Biden policies on his journey to the United States. Ruiz first escaped to Brazil, then discovered he could try for U.S. asylum and headed to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019. But when he tried to cross, border agents sent him back to Mexico under a different Trump-era policy, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, that forced migrants to wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings. Ruiz was stuck in a shelter in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez for two years until Biden reversed the policy soon after he took office this year. Ruiz was finally allowed across the border in March to start a new life with his family in Miami while pursuing his asylum case. ""The only thing that Biden did was restore internationally protected asylum laws that Trump had violated,"" said Ruiz in a phone interview. ""That was the only change.""

Beijing Lends Fellow Communists a Hand: 'China Stands Ready to Work with Cuba',https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/13/beijing-lends-fellow-communists-hand-china-stands-ready-work-cuba/,07/13/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed on Tuesday that the United States was single-handedly responsible for all woes that Cuban people suffer under communism and asserted Beijing ""stands ready to work with Cuba,"" presumably to suppress the nationwide protests that began this weekend. Cuba is a member of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an infrastructure debt trap program run by the Communist Party of China, and is one of Beijings oldest allies. Both countries are members of the United Nations Human Rights Council and energetically defend themselves in that venue against the overwhelming evidence of human rights atrocities committed by their respective regimes. Protests erupted in at least 20 municipalities throughout Cuba on Sunday calling for an end to the 62-year communist rule people have endured there. While Cuban dissident organizations have invested decades in organizing civil society to demand respect for their basic civil rights, plans to challenge the regime accelerated this year as groups organized conventions to plan a transition out of communism and focused attempting on recruiting pop stars and other artists to the cause. Chronic food shortages and a collapsed healthcare system, hallmarks of all communists regimes, exacerbated the need for protests during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, the official responsible for the discredited conspiracy theory that the Chinese coronavirus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory, issued the first comment from the Chinese government on the ongoing protests in Cuba on Tuesday. ""China firmly opposes foreign interference in Cubas internal affairs, firmly supports what Cuba has done in fighting COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], improving peoples livelihood and upholding social stability,"" Zhao said, ""and firmly supports Cuba in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions."" Cuba has a notoriously poor track record in handling the coronavirus pandemic that includes inviting tourists from hotspots like Italy to visit the island at the height of the pandemic and refusing to shut down schools. ""Id like to stress that China stands ready to work with Cuba to implement the important consensus of the two heads of state and is firmly committed to deepening friendly relations between the two countries,"" Zhao added. He did not specify in what way China would be ""ready to work"" with Cuba, leaving open the possibility that Beijing would support Cubas repression of dissidents in the context of the protests this week. Cuban human rights groups believe hundreds of peaceful protesters are either in police custody illegally or have disappeared. Death tolls have not surfaced so far but dissidents have shared videos on social media showing police opening fire into crowds of unarmed protesters, leaving some on the ground, bloodied and appearing to suffer from gunshot wounds. Other images out of Cuba show police flagrantly beating unarmed protesters in broad daylight. Zhao also took the opportunity to condemn the government of the United States, which has played no role in the protests. ""As the Cuban side pointed out, the US embargo is the root cause of Cubas shortage of medicines and energy,"" Zhao falsely claimed. ""The US should fully lift its embargo on Cuba and play a positive role in helping the Cuban people overcome the effects of the epidemic."" The U.S. ""embargo"" does not prevent shipments of medicine or humanitarian supplies to Cuba. It has also done little to prevent tourism to the island, and it does not prevent Cuba from trading with over 190 countries around the world. The true embargo banning humanitarian aid from directly reaching Cubans in necessary quantities is a policy implemented by the Castro regime once American supplies arrive in Communist Party custody, where much of it disappears into the bureaucracy instead of the hands of its intended recipients. China extended its support to Cuba on the anniversary of the 1994 massacre of 41 civilians on the March 13 tugboat, at the time attempting to flee the country by sea to the United States. Cuban officials flooded the vessel, carrying 72 people, using hoses in international waters. Several of the victims were toddlers; the youngest was a six-month-old girl. China became Cubas largest trade partner in 2017 and began investing heavily in Cuban infrastructure after Miguel Diaz-Canel, appointed the face of the Castro regime in 2018, visited Beijing that year and signed onto the Belt and Road Initiative. ""As socialist countries, China and Cuba are good friends, comrades, and brothers,"" Chinese dictator Xi Jinping said during his meeting with Diaz-Canel at the time. ""Chinese people will never forget that Cuba, led by Comrade Fidel Castro, was the first nation in the western hemisphere to forge diplomatic ties with China 58 years ago."" A year later, Cuba debuted a Chinese-built railway connecting Havana and Santiago de Cuba, the countrys two largest cities on opposite ends of the island. No evidence suggests Cuban citizens received jobs or benefits from the infrastructure project in any way, as Cuba bought the rail cars pre-made from China with a 15-year Chinese loan. Like most BRI agreements, the provisions of the deal remain a secret. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

Man dies in anti-government protest in Cuba: Interior ministry,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/13/man-dies-in-anti-government-protest-in-cuba-interior-ministry,07/13/21,www.aljazeera.com,"Rare demonstrations spurred by a deepening economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic rock Cuba in recent days. A man died during an anti-government protest on Monday on the outskirts of Havana, the Cuban interior ministry said on Tuesday, as rare demonstrations spurred by economic inequalities have rocked the island. Protesters took to the streets of the Cuban capital as well as other cities across the country on Sunday to denounce the government of President Miguel Diaz-Canel amid food shortages and a deep economic crisis worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. The rallies have been met with a wave of arrests and allegations of police brutality, as authorities cracked down on demonstrators. The interior ministry said on Tuesday that it ""mourns the death"" of a 36-year-old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, who the state news agency said had taken part in the ""disturbances"". The Cuban News Agency said ""organised groups of antisocial and criminal elements"" had tried to reach the suburb of La Guineras police station, with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging the infrastructure. Several citizens and security officials were injured in the protest, the report also said. It did not say how the man died. This is the first confirmed death linked to the protests, which are the largest in Cuba in decades. Waldo Herrera, a 49-year-old resident of La Guinera, told the Reuters news agency that protesters were ""marching peacefully, shouting slogans like 'Down with communism, 'freedom for the people of Cuba, 'we dont have medicine, we need food.'"" Herrera said the protesters started throwing stones at security forces, who eventually responded with gunfire. Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, calling on defenders of the Cuban revolution to take to the streets on Sunday to counter the anti-government demonstrators. The Cuban president also said US sanctions on the country are fuelling misery. Amnesty International said it had received with alarm reports of ""internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force - including police firing on demonstrators"". At least 100 protesters, activists, and independent journalists had been detained nationwide since Sunday, according to exiled rights group Cubalex. Some were detained at the protests but others as they tried to leave their homes, the organisation said. The Cuban government did not immediately comment on the arrests. Cuba also has seen a recent surge in coronavirus infections, as doctors and nurses urge people to get jabs to stem the spread of the virus. The country has reported more than 250,500 cases and more than 1,600 deaths to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data. On Tuesday, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks said the Cuban government has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp. NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegraph in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday. ""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organize and share news of protests in real-time,"" said the groups director, Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality."" People shout slogans against the government during a protest in Havana on July 11 [Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] Havana-based journalist Reed Lindsay told Al Jazeera that mobile phone data remained down for most residents on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Cubas foreign minister has blamed the US of waging a ""fake news campaign"" to stoke the unrest amid a deluge of misinformation on social media, he said. ""Its very difficult to pin down what is going,"" he said. ""There are a lot of rumors floating around."" As the uncertainty in Cuba continues, US Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday said migrants considering making a journey to the US irregularly by sea will not be allowed into the country. ""Any migrant intercepted at sea, regardless of their nationality, will not be permitted to enter the United States,"" Mayorkas said in a news briefing. ""This risk is not worth taking."" It is not yet clear whether the unrest could lead to even more people trying to flee the island, which is just across the Florida Straits from the US.

Cuba restricts access to social media apps to curb protests,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/7/14/cuba-restricts-access-to-social-media-apps-to-curb-protests,07/14/21,www.aljazeera.com,"Mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests and activists say government is restricting access to messaging apps. Cuba has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks has said, in the wake of the biggest anti-government protests in decades. Thousands of Cubans joined demonstrations throughout the Communist-run country on Sunday to protest against a deep economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website on Tuesday that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday. ""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organise and share news of protests in real-time,"" said NetBlocks director Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality."" Cubas government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by counterrevolutionaries financed by the United States, manipulating frustration with an economic crisis largely caused by the decades-old US trade embargo. The protests, rare in a country where public dissent is tightly controlled, had largely ended by Sunday evening, as security forces were deployed to the streets and President Miguel Diaz-Canel called on government supporters to go out and fight to defend their revolution. But another protest flared late on Monday in the southern Havana suburb of La Guinera, where one man died and several others, including members of the security forces, were hospitalised with injuries, according to state-run media on Tuesday. It did not say what caused the death. No other deaths and injuries have been officially confirmed so far. Hundreds had taken to streets in La Guinera, shouting slogans such as ""Down with communism"" and ""Freedom for the people of Cuba"" according to two residents and video footage seen by the Reuters news agency. Some started throwing rocks at security forces who eventually responded with gunfire, said resident Waldo Herrera, 49. ""I think the Communists have lost control, they wont have a solution to this situation,"" he said. ""The people are tired of so much humiliation, so much repression."" A Reuters witness saw dozens of people carrying sticks departing La Guinera late on Monday. Activists say the government is using so-called rapid-reaction brigades - government-organised bands of civilian recruits - to counter protesters. Mobile internet disrupted They also accuse the government of trying to disrupt communications. Introduced just over two years ago, mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests, giving Cubans more of a platform to express their frustrations and enabling the word to get out quickly when people are on the street. In the capital, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses. Facebook Inc, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said that it was concerned about its services being restricted in Cuba, in a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. ""We oppose shutdowns, throttling, and other disruptions of the internet that limit the debate of our community. We hope connectivity will be restored as soon as possible so that Cubans can communicate with family and friends,"" said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. Asked whether the government was intentionally restricting internet connections, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news briefing the situation was ""complicated."" He said power outages could affect telecommunications services and ""Cuba would never renounce the right to defend itself"". Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc said it found no blocking of its service. ""Our weapon is the internet. If they take away the internet we are unarmed,"" said Havana resident Gino Ocumares, as he tried but failed to connect to the internet at a government WiFi hotspot. ""The government does not want people to see the truth."" 'Provocations The protest in La Guinera was spearheaded by ""antisocial and criminal elements"" that had tried to reach the police station with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging infrastructure, said the state-run Cuban News Agency. Cuba says 'antisocial and criminal elements are behind the protests [File: Yamil Lage/AFP] When security forces stopped them, they vandalised homes, set containers on fire, and damaged the suburbs electrical wiring, attacking officials with stones and other objects, the agency said. State-run media also reported on Tuesday that Raul Castro, who stepped down as head of the ruling Cuban Communist Party in April, attended a meeting on Sunday of the political bureau to address the ""provocations"". Diaz-Canel said in April he would continue to consult Castro on matters of utmost importance. The Cuban Bishops Conference said in a statement it was worried that the response to protests over legitimate concerns would be ""immobilism"" rather than an attempt to resolve them, and even a counterproductive hardening of positions. Reaction to the protest in Latin America split along ideological lines, with Mexicos president blaming the US embargo for fomenting the unrest, while Chile and Peru urged the government to allow pro-democracy protests. US President Joe Biden said on Monday that the United States ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights"". State Department spokesman Ned Price called on the Havana government to open all means of communication, online and offline. ""Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways - that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people,"" Price told a news briefing on Tuesday.",

Cuban-Americans Flood Cities Nationwide Calling for End to Communism,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/cuban-americans-flood-cities-nationwide-calling-for-end-to-communism/,07/14/21,www.breitbart.com,"NORTH BERGEN, New Jersey - Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Cuban-Americans have convened for peaceful assemblies nationwide this week in solidarity with their kin on the island, who have flooded the streets of nearly every major Cuban city since Sunday demanding an end to the communist regime. Cuban-Americans and their allies in New Jersey, New York, Kentucky, Illinois, California, Ohio, and Washington, DC, have organized ""free Cuba"" rallies meant to encourage Cubans on the island to continue peacefully demanding an end to communism and to urge the government of the United States - particularly the administration of President Joe Biden - to act to protect Cuban lives. Naturally, however, Florida - home to the nations largest Cuban-American population, hosted the largest and most recurring assemblies against communism on the island. Protesters there shut down the Palmetto Expressway, the largest highway connecting the city, on Tuesday, and have maintained a consistent presence at the historic Cuban restaurant Versalles urging an American military intervention in the situation. In contrast to the overwhelmingly destructive riots in support of left-wing causes last summer, the Cuban freedom movement has organized peaceful protests nationwide, with minimal reports of police activity and no significant property damage. In response to the protests, the face of the Castro regime, Miguel Diaz-Canel, issued an ""order of combat"" urging communist vigilantes to violently attack anyone peacefully protesting in their neighborhoods, essentially calling for civil war. The Cuban government shut down internet access nearly nationwide, making it difficult to track police activity, but dissident groups fear hundreds are missing and dozens dead after police began opening fire on crowds of protesters and detaining people in door-to-door raids. On Tuesday night, hundreds of Cuban-Americans and allies marched on Bergenline Avenue in North Bergen, Guttenberg, and West New York, New Jersey - a historic commercial district largely rebuilt by Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 1970s following its collapse in the post-World War II era. While Hudson County, where these small municipalities are located, has been solidly Democrat strongholds for over a century, Democrat politicians in the area are traditionally vocally anti-communist. The mayors of several local cities attended the rally and pressured Washington to intervene in the violence in Cuba.

""I believe the United States shouldve been there years ago. Just like weve liberated other countries, we should liberate Cuba, make that country free for the Cuban people. Stop all the politics all around.""

In another growing Cuban-American enclave - Louisville, Kentucky - hundreds of people organized a protest Tuesday urging American action to help prevent casualties on the island. ""Tuesdays organizers tell us this was the largest event theyve seen in Louisville,"" local broadcasters WHAS 11 reported, ""beating out nearly 900 people who showed up to Shively Park this past weekend."" Cincinnatis Fountain Square, about an hour and a half from Louisville, held its own pro-Cuba protest on Tuesday. Local outlets reported that about 80 people attended the rally, significant as Cincinnati does not boast a notably large Cuban-American population and is only about an hour and a half from Louisville, making that a likelier host city for such an event. Chicagoans took the streets on Monday for the same cause. ""People have to say 'enough is enough,"" Alberto Gonzalez, the owner of 90 Miles Cuban Cafe in the city, told local news station WGN. ""I lived in Cuba and know what its like not to eat for a few days. I left in 1980. I can only imagine today how bad it is."" One of Los Angeles oldest Cuban establishments, Portos cafe, hosted a rally on Sunday in solidarity with the cause, as well.

Protesters stormed the Palmetto Expressway on Tuesday and shut it down. The sidewalk outside of Versailles - a restaurant known for its little window (ventanita) where older Cubans congregate to drink coffee and shout about politics - has hosted hundreds of people since Sunday. Another historic Cuban-American location, Tamiami Park, also held multiple rallies this week. The Tamiami Park event on Tuesday also commemorated the 27-year anniversary of the March 13 tugboat massacre, in which the Cuban communist regime drowned 37 people in international waters attempting to flee the country. The group was unarmed and included several toddlers. The youngest victim was a six-month-old girl. ""Were commemorating one massacre now, and were trying to prevent another one,"" Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the head of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, told WPLG Local 10.

Miami mayor urges Biden to consider airstrikes against Cuba's Communist regime,https://nypost.com/2021/07/14/airstrikes-against-cuban-regime-should-be-considered-miami-mayor-suarez-says/,07/14/21,nypost.com,"The mayor of Miami, Florida, has called on the US to consider military action to overthrow the Communist regime in Cuba -- even if that means launching airstrikes. Francis Suarez -- whose father was Miamis first Cuban-born mayor -- told Fox News on Tuesday that ""what should be being contemplated right now is a coalition of potential military action in Cuba."" He highlighted previous US military action in Panama, Kosovo and Pakistan, the latter of which ""probably saved thousands"" of lives by killing Osama bin Laden when President Biden was vice president. ""Are you suggesting airstrikes in Cuba?"" Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked. ""What Im suggesting is that that option is one that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table,"" Suarez insisted.

AFP via Getty Images ""Thats something that needs to be discussed and needs to looked as a potential option in addition to a variety of other options that can be discussed."" He later told the Miami Herald that he was expecting a call from the president -- and planned to ask him to consider military intervention. ""Its difficult for any elected official, Republican or Democrat, not to take the side of the Cuban people when they see images of people risking their lives, protesting in the streets,"" he said of the mass demonstrations. Suarez also stressed that ""the Cuban people are not asking for the lifting of an embargo"" enforced by the US. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images He also stressed that ""the Cuban people are not asking for the lifting of an embargo"" enforced by the US, which Cuban officials and many on the left have blamed for the protests. ""Theyre not yelling out, 'End the embargo. Theyre not yelling out, 'We need food. Theyre yelling out, 'We want liberty, we want freedom,'"" he told MacCallum. ""Theyre going out on the streets every single day talking about the failure of the Communist regime to provide for its people. And it has failed for six decades,"" he said. Since protests broke out in Cuba over the weekend, thousands have also taken to the streets of Florida, home to the largest US population of Cuban Americans -- closing down a number of major roads on Tuesday.

""Allow me to be clear: If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" Mayorkas said at a news conference. Cuba on Sunday had its largest protests in decades, with citizens denouncing the Communist leadership and a lack of food and COVID-19 vaccines. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated last week, sparking a political crisis. The DHS secretary said the Coast Guard is monitoring the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico and that ""any migrant intercepted at sea, regardless of their nationality, will not be permitted to enter the United States."" Instead, sea migrants will either be returned to their home country or sent to a third country if they make a credible claim of ""fear of persecution or torture.""

AFP via Getty Images Mayorkas, whose family fled Cuba in 1960 when he was a baby, said that so far there hasnt been a surge in boat refugees from the countries. Only 470 Cubans and 313 Haitians have been intercepted aboard boats and rafts in fiscal 2021. There were 49 Cubans and 430 Haitians intercepted in fiscal 2020. Cuban American voters in Florida helped former President Donald Trump easily carry the state last year after he claimed repeatedly that Democratic policies could turn the US into a socialist country like the one they left.

DeSantis Team Pushes Back After Media Blasts Cuba Protests,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/14/desantis-team-pushes-back-establishment-media-salivates-peaceful-cuba-protests-these-are-not-riots/,07/14/21,www.breitbart.com,"Gov. Ron DeSantiss (R-FL) office is pushing back after members of the establishment media, particularly in Florida, accused the governor of hypocrisy by asserting he is not using his anti-riot law to halt peaceful demonstrations in the state. The Miami Heralds editorial board published a piece Tuesday with a glaring headline loaded with suspicion: ""DeSantis anti-riot law didnt apply as Cuba protesters shut down a Miami-Dade road. Hmmm..."" ""Floridas misbegotten anti-riot law leaves even peaceful demonstrators subject to being arrested if a protest is arbitrarily deemed a 'riot. The law explicitly makes blocking a highway a felony offense,"" the board wrote. ""Worse, it gives civil legal immunity to people who drive through protesters who are blocking a road -- basically, encouraging haters to do just that,"" it asserted. The editorial boards bitter diatribe followed peaceful demonstrations in the state as people stood in solidarity with thousands of Cubans who took to their own streets to protest the oppressive, communist regime. One of the Florida demonstrations saw protesters blocking State Road 826 on Tuesday, prompting DeSantis critics to sound the alarm. But, as DeSantiss office pointed out, protesters were compliant with local law enforcement, and that is exactly what the anti-riot law does -- empowers local law enforcement. Demonstrators were not attacking police officers, charging vehicles, or defacing property, all of which served as hallmarks of the violent Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests that devastated communities across the country last year. Even ABC News recognized the crowd of demonstrators as ""peaceful."" However, the Miami Heralds editorial board overlooked those factors and offered a suggested quote for the governor: ""Nah, the Miami-Dade demonstrators seeking human rights in Cuba have nothing to fear from my anti-riot law. We created it to subdue Black folks seeking human rights in the United States."" It wasnt a riot. But whatever racist wrote this anti-Cuban American propaganda should be fired. https://t.co/FCRlB3rwHp -- Cernovich (@Cernovich) July 14, 2021 #BREAKING - The Palmetto Expressway (SR-826) has been shut down in both directions near Coral Way and SW 32nd Street as protestors voicing their support for the people of Cuba went onto the expressway. pic.twitter.com/8cCFNmL5m7 -- WSVN 7 News (@wsvn) July 13, 2021 DeSantis signed Floridas anti-riot bill in April, which effectively takes defunding the police ""off the table"" in Sunshine State. It also strengthens penalties for those who engage in lawless behavior during a riot. Authorities did not deem the peaceful protests seen in Florida as riots, and, notably, blocking highways was already an illegal act prior to the anti-riot law. Further, the law explicitly defines a riot as a ""'violent public disturbance involving an assembly of three or more persons, acting with a common intent to assist each other in violent and disorderly conduct, resulting in either injury to another person, property damage, or 'imminent danger or injury to another person or damage to property,"" as Breitbart News detailed. The law also increases penalties for assault or battery on first responders -- something that did not occur at the Florida demonstration the Herald referenced, either. Christina Pushaw, press secretary for DeSantis, told Breitbart News exclusively that the administration is going to continue to allow law enforcement to do their job, and emphasized that the demonstrations in Florida have been ""peaceful protests,"" not riots. ""Were going to let law enforcement do their jobs, as always. Weve also always urged protests to be peaceful. The demonstrations in Florida for freedom in Cuba have been peaceful protests, not riots,"" Pushaw said, adding it is not the governors role to micromanage local law enforcement agencies. ""It is not the role of the Governors office to direct the Florida Highway Patrol, or any other law enforcement agency, to conduct their day-to-day jobs protecting and serving Floridians,"" she added. Breitbart News spoke to DeSantis after he signed the anti-riot bill in April -- an action that followed sweeping calls from the left to defund police. ""The more blue an area is, the worse its governed. I mean its just a disaster what weve seen. Its always been the case kind of in my lifetime, but I think in the last year, its been exacerbated between COVID [Chinese coronavirus] lockdowns and the rioting,"" DeSantis told Breitbart News at the time. ""If you dont stand up for law enforcement, you are going to have more crimes,"" he said, explaining the law draws a line in the sand regarding defunding law enforcement. ""If they want to take money from law enforcement, I as governor and some of my Cabinet members here or there, we can veto that and make them restore the funding,"" he said. ""So that, I think that takes the defunding law enforcement off the table in Florida, which is huge."" DeSantis also explained how the law enhanced criminal penalties for those engaging in lawless behavior during a riot. ""For example, if you throw a brick, if youre in one of these violent assemblies, you throw a brick at a police officer, youre getting arrested, youre going to jail, and youre staying there until your first appearance,"" the governor said. Notably, no bricks flew at the Florida demonstration the Herald referenced. ""They are revolting against a corrupt communist dictatorship that has ruled that island with an iron fist for over 60 years, that is responsible for death and destruction, not just on the island of Cuba but really throughout the Western Hemisphere, with their actions supporting other Marxist regimes,"" DeSantis said of the protests in Cuba during a roundtable discussion Tuesday, dismissing any comparisons to the Black Lives Matter protests last year. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" he said, adding that the current Florida demonstrations are ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer.""",
WATCH: Biden White House Refuses to Say Cubans Are Opposing Communism,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/watch-biden-white-house-refuses-to-say-cubans-are-opposing-communism-psaki/,07/14/21,www.breitbart.com,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to blame communism for the current unrest in Cuba on Wednesday, when asked by Peter Doocy of Fox News whether communism was the reason that people might want to flee Cuba for the U.S. The context of Doocys question was a previous query about a statement Tuesday by Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas that Cubans and Haitians should not come to the U.S. by sea -- though the administration is making illegal entry easier through the southern land border with Mexico. The following exchange occurred during Wednesdays White House press briefing: Doocy: As the administration tries to figure out the ""root causes"" of migration to the country, dont we know that the reason people want to leave Cuba is because they dont like communism? Psaki: We- Doocy: And so as youre trying to figure out, like, what the processes are for these people who want to leave Cuba, is -- Psaki: Well, Im not sure what your question is. Doocy: You guys have spent a lot of time -- Psaki: why are people leaving Cuba, or what is the process for them getting here? I can explain either of them, but you tell me. Doocy: Sure, yeah. Do you think people are leaving Cuba because they dont like communism ? Psaki: I think weve been pretty clear that we think people are leaving Cuba, or not -- leaving Cuba, or protesting in the streets, as well, because they are opposed to the oppression, to the mismanagement of the government in the country. And we certainly support their right to protest, we support their efforts to speak out against their treatment in Cuba. I will say, separately, an important question is also what happens when people are seeking protection, or what happens when they are attempting to flee. In the past, as I noted, weve had several humanitarian programs ... But certainly, we have said many times, and I will reiterate here, that we support not just the role of the protest, and peaceful protests, we stand with the Cuban people in their call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime. Biden claimed during the 2020 election to have ""taken on the Castros of the world,"" but enthusiastically supported President Barack Obamas ""normalization"" policy with the Castro regime during his tenure as vice president. The Biden administration initially blamed the unrest in Cuba on frustration over rising COVID cases. Joel B.

Biden Inaction Triggers Growing Calls for U.S. Military Action on Cuba,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/biden-inaction-triggers-growing-calls-us-military-action-cuba/,07/14/21,www.breitbart.com,"A series of tepid and inaccurate statements from President Joe Biden and his administration are meeting growing calls this week for the American government to act to prevent the further loss of life in Cuba. Protesters took the streets in dozens of municipalities nationwide in Cuba on Sunday; some estimates suggest as many as 60 cities and towns rose up demanding an end to communism. The protests were the culmination of nearly two decades of organized dissident action in the country since the Black Spring of 2003, that last major violent crackdown en masse on pro-democracy voices in the country. Protesters chanted ""freedom!"" and other anti-communist slogans, making clear their demand was an end to the 62-year-old Castro regime. The Cuban Communist Party responded by issuing an ""order of combat"" commanding all communist loyalists to take the streets and violently assault peaceful protesters. It also shut down the internet for much of this week, making international reporting on the matter extremely difficult. The little information Cubans have managed to get out of the island indicates that protests have continued daily since Sunday despite widespread reports of police gang beatings, assassinations, and deadly door-to-door raids. The violence, much of it caught on video, prompted a wave of protests nationwide in the United States in solidarity with the protesters. Cuban-Americans in every major population hub they have in the country have taken the streets in urged Biden to do more than offer verbal solidarity with their brethren. Bidens administration has so far falsely stated that the protests are about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic -- on multiple occasions -- and has taken no action in response to the situation. Biden himself issued a statement urging ""the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment instead of enriching themselves,"" without mentioning communism or socialism, the issues the protesters are actively opposing. Protesters around the country have escalated their calls for military intervention against the Castro regime to defend the lives of unarmed, peaceful Cuban protesters. In front of the White House, protesters on Monday called for ""urgent military intervention"" in remarks to Univision. In Miami, a group of protesters demanding military intervention blocked the Palmetto Expressway, the main highway in the city, on Tuesday. ""The longer we wait the more people will die. The longer that America waits to intervene the more people will die,"" one Miami protester told a local ABC News affiliate. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) made the most prominent call for U.S. military action so far on Fox News on Tuesday. ""What should be being contemplated right now is a coalition of potential military action in Cuba similar to what has happened in both administrations in both Republican and Democrat administrations,"" Suarez said. ""And Republican -- with Bush in Panama, they deposed Noriega. And that country had peaceful democracy for decades. And you had interventions by a Democratic president taking out Osama bin Laden in Pakistan."" Suarez added that airstrikes against the regime is an option ""that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table."" Suarez made a similar call to action in a press conference prior to the interview this week, joined by several other prominent American politicians including Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL). At least one Democrat in the country -- the mayor of Union City, New Jersey, the largest Cuban-American enclave in the country outside of Florida -- has similarly demanded military intervention. ""We need to see action. We need to see military action,"" Mayor Brian Stack told hundreds assembled at a rally on Tuesday in New Jerseys north Hudson region. Speaking to NJ.com, Stack added, ""I believe the United States shouldve been there years ago. Just like weve liberated other countries, we should liberate Cuba, make that country free for the Cuban people. Stop all the politics all around."" A petition at Change.org urging military intervention has attracted nearly 400,000 signatures as of Wednesday, suggesting the idea is more popular than many establishment media outlets in the United States have suggested. ""The free Cubans around the world petition, without a doubt, for a MILITARY INTERVENTION by the United States of America and NATO to put an end to the Castro/Diaz-Canel regime and liberate the Cuban people who live in terror, misery, hunger and coercion!"" the petition reads in part. What such an intervention would look like is the subject of much speculation -- and much debate. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a coalition of dissident organizations on the island, published a five-point plan to liberate Cuba on Sunday: The termination of the Regime is non-negotiable. All those involved in the peaceful civic protest must stay out in the streets and maintain their commitment to a free Cuba. All national Police and Armed Forces must support the citizens and uphold their duty to their country and not the communist regime. International intervention led by the United States in order to prevent a bloodbath. The immediate cessation of all tourism to Cuba until the dictatorship has been dismantled. Speaking to Breitbart News, Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, the director of the Assembly, listed military intervention as one of the factors in a greater plan for the U.S. government to properly aid the Cuban people. Cuban activists, he noted, must ""push for decisive international intervention led by the U.S. to protect the Cuban people and isolate and end the communist regime."" ""Intervention means decisive military action,"" Gutierrez-Boronat added. ""There are many different ways of this being done -- humanitarian assistance, but also as part of the military intervention, that is the most important and decisive."" The Assembly further demands the U.S. government not lift any sanctions against Cuba ""or its satellite regimes in the region"" (Biden already defied this one by lifting sanctions on Venezuela on Monday), help improve telecommunications on the island to prevent the regime from shutting down internet and cutting information access; and recognizing a provisional authority of members of the Cuban resistance to help guide the transition away from communism. Assembly members have been working for months on a plan to facilitate the peaceful transition away from the current regime. Over 20 organizations belonging to the Assembly organized a nationwide ""Congress of the Cuban Nation"" last month to discuss the political underpinnings of a post-communist, free Cuba, including the creation of a transition government and free and fair elections. The meetings sought to create ""a new republic -- [to] create a roadmap for transition and reconstruction of the country in all sectors."" Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

Rubio, a Florida Republican of Cuban descent, also slammed Twitter as ""hypocrites"" for failing to block the Cuban regime -- after famously banning former President Donald Trump. ""Im not in favor of Twitter banning anybody, but if theyre going to do it, if youre going to go after American politicians and block their tweets, censor their tweets and even deny them access to these platforms,"" he told Fox News, ""then you have to do it to a brutal dictator whos on Twitter, along with other members of the regime."" Rubio also took to Twitter himself to demand that the Biden administration take action against the Cuban Communist regime. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel urged supporters to confront the protesters.

""Convene the United Nations, convene the Organization of American States in emergency session. Sen.

""Not halfway around the world, not in the Middle East, not in another continent, right here, 90 miles from our shores."" ""A horrific bloodbath is what awaits if action is not taken,"" Rubio added. ""So far the response has been weak, weak. Why?"" Rubios call to action comes after the Cuban Interior Ministry revealed that one person was killed after thousands took to the streets to demand food and freedom, NBC affiliate WTVJ-TV reported. Diubis Laurencio Tejada, 36, was killed Monday outside Havana, the outlet said. The violence on the island has sparked protests in the US as well, including Miami, which is home to the largest concentration of Cuban Americans in the country. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez on Tuesday urged the White House to consider airstrikes and a military assault on the Cuban government to aid the demonstrators. Meanwhile, Cuban government officials continue to take a hard line against the protesters, and blamed the US for inciting the unrest in the country.",

Rubios comments come as bloody Monday left Cuban protestors beaten and likely shot by Cuban police for protesting communism and Marxism. Fifty-seven people have either disappeared or been arrested since protests erupted throughout the island Sunday night. Breitbart News reported Tuesday a near-nationwide internet blackout severely limited the ability of protesters to share updates and images from the protest, but the little that has trickled out suggests Cuba experienced another wave of thousands-strong protests Monday that has triggered severe communist repression. Meanwhile, in America, rallies were organized to support the Cuban peoples desire for liberty in New Jersey, New York, Kentucky, Illinois, California, Ohio, Washington, DC, and Florida. In Florida Tuesday, pro-freedom protesters there shut down the Palmetto Expressway, the largest highway connecting south Florida, and have maintained a consistent presence at the historic Cuban restaurant Versailles, urging an American military intervention in the situation. The White Houses response Monday to the events were to presume that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests were actually demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" ""There is a global [sic] pandemic right now, most people in that country dont have access to vaccines; thats certainly something wed love to help with,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""I would say that when people are out there on the street protesting and complaining about the lack of access to, uh, economic prosperity, uh, to the medical supplies they need to a life they deserve to live, uh, that can take on a range of meaning."" President Joe Biden also issued a statement Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people"" against their repressive communist government but failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security. Rubio, for his part, called on Congress Tuesday to characterize the political nature of totalitarianism in Cuba as ""communist,"" ""Marxist,"" and ""socialist.""

Miamis El Nuevo Herald identified the victim in the video as Daniel Cardenas Diaz, a 24-year-old father of three who had participated in peaceful protests against communism this week. An eyewitness recorded the video at his family home in Cardenas, Matanzas province, east of Havana. His wife, Marbely Vasquez, confirmed to the newspaper that Cardenas had participated in protests, but that he was a peaceful marcher, had not committed any violent acts, and did not stand out in his behavior among the thousands of protesters that took the streets of Cuba this weekend. The familys three children -- a pair of two-year-old twins and a 12-year-old -- were in the home when the attack occurred. Protests erupted Sunday in over 20 municipalities nationwide demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime and freedom for the Cuban people. Protesters used their rudimentary mobile phones and internet access to film the large assemblies and distribute images that showed the scope of rejection of the regime to the rest of the world. That evening, Castro regime head Miguel Diaz-Canel issued an ""order of combat"" encouraging civilians to take the streets and attack the protesters. The Cuban regime then shut down access to the internet to prevent word of protests from getting out, though citizens used their family connections abroad to send the word that protests continued into Wednesday throughout the island. The video of the home invasion in Cardenas first surfaced on the Facebook profile of Eduardo Perez. In addition to El Nuevo Herald and other Cuban interest publications confirming the authenticity and date of the video, the human rights group Cuban Prisoners Defenders identified the exact street the invasion occurred on and more specifically identified the victim as Joel Daniel Cardenas Diaz. The video shows shaky images of Cuban special forces, or ""black berets,"" invading a residence. A woman off-camera, presumably Vasquez, can be heard shouting, ""my children are here, I dont want them to do anything to my children."" The camera then shows Vasquez holding a toddler; the other twin can be seen standing next to her. The camera suddenly pivots in response to the arrival of a black beret and a police attack dog into the home. When the image returns, it shows a large pool of blood on the floor where the victim in question had been. Vasquez says that communist state security forces beat her husband viciously, then shot him and took him out of the home. ""Why did they do this, theres nothing in my house,"" the woman cries. ""They broke everything. They took everything. They broke everything of mine."" In addition to the uniformed regime agents, the video shows a mob of apparent civilians armed with blunt metal objects. According to Vasquez, the mob and the police officers beat Cardenas severely, causing most of the pool of blood on the floor. He sustained at least one gunshot wound. Warning - graphic images: Posibles datos del herido gravemente al ser asaltada su vivienda en Velazquez, entre Palma y Campina, Cardenas. Efectivos entraron con violencia al domicilio y dispararon a ""Joel Daniel Cardenas Diaz"" delante de su mujer y su hija ES NECESARIO CONTRASTAR:https://t.co/POBY6xJHao pic.twitter.com/B7OqlHcDCZ -- Prisoners Defenders (@CubanDefenders) July 14, 2021 El Nuevo Herald quoted Vasquez as saying that police told her they had taken her husband to a police station to receive medical care, but no confirmation exists as of Wednesday afternoon that Cardenas is alive. The attack, she said, occurred around 11 a.m. on Tuesday. It also remains unclear what police meant by receiving medical care, as they apparently told Vasquez to try to independently obtain an analgesic for her husband. The Miami newspaper also made contact with Cardenas cousin in Tampa, Orlando Leon, who said the victim remained ""incomunicado."" ""He was at the march, but if it were for that, theyd have to kill everyone; theyd have to kill the entire population of Cuba,"" Leon said. The independent Cuban online publication 14 y Medio, many reporters of which have been under effective house arrest since the protests erupted, reported Wednesday that it had evidence of at least 5,000 arrests nationwide. Authorities have not made clear if they have charged anyone with any crime. In Cuba, disagreement with the regime is officially criminal under the law banning ""disrespect"" (desacato), leading to many convictions of individuals for speaking freely about their government. To limit international condemnation of its human rights abuses, however, the regime often arrests prominent dissidents for short periods of time, beating them in police custody, and releases them without pressing charges. Some activists report being arrested on a weekly basis, essentially resulting in an extended restriction on their freedoms without due process. Police, the newspaper added, appeared to be especially pursuing journalists, members of political dissident organizations, and civilians with a known social media footprint of criticism of the government. The Castro regime identified one person killed in the protests, 36-year-old Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, on Tuesday; dissident organizations fear the death toll is far higher given multiple instances documented of police opening fire on peaceful crowds in major cities. Hundreds of people also reportedly remain missing, raising concerns regarding their health. The Cuban regime claims the protests are a fabrication by the U.S. government, an allegation for which it has produced no credible evidence. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

The White House says Biden's primary goal is helping the people of Cuba as they reel from pandemic-driven economic woes. Two sources familiar with the review said on Wednesday it could lead to the easing of restrictions on payments Americans can make to their families in Cuba.

"Cubans Rally in South Florida, Denounce Communism",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/14/cubans-rally-in-florida-communism-the-last-thing-you-want-for-a-country-like-america/,07/14/21,www.breitbart.com,"NAPLES, Florida - Hundreds of Cubans gathered in south Florida on Tuesday to protest -- not the lack of medical supplies in Cuba -- but the brutal communist regime abusing their family and friends back home. Cuban and American flags filled the streets of downtown Naples as protesters joined others around the country and in Cuba to oppose a dictatorship that has gripped the island since 1959, when Fidel Castro took over. ""It is misinformation that COVID [Chinese coronavirus] and hunger is causing the protests in Cuba. Thats not the truth. People are tired of the government. They are tired of not being free, and thats what they are fighting for,"" said protester and local singer Yenier Alvarino, who is part of a musical duo with Adrian Arteaga called Arteaga y El Yen. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in at least 20 provinces in Cuba on Sunday to peacefully demand the end of communism. The waves of discontent were captured on social media, which helped Cubans communicate across the country and band together for the islands largest demonstration in decades. Though protests have continued, hundreds of people are likely missing and police have reportedly peppered crowds with bullets to subdue opposition. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the Castro regime, responded to the protests by urging ""revolutionaries"" to violently assault unarmed protesters on the streets, describing his call as an ""order of combat,"" Breitbart News reported. In response to Diaz-Canels order, both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers have unleashed a wave of repression on protesters that has included shooting at them, attacking them with dogs, and public beatings. The regime also appeared to shut down internet access to stem the flow of ""citizen journalist videos depicting extreme repression."" "" Yes I do -- we all do,"" Arteaga said at the Naples protest when Breitbart News asked if he still has family in Cuba. Arteaga said he came to the United States when he was 18 years old ""looking for freedom."" Naples, which is two hours across the state from Miami, has a relatively large Cuban population. Many families move to the beachside town in search of a more suburban lifestyle than Miami offers, and most have relatives and friends still in Cuba. ""Its really hard. Some of our families only communicate to us through WhatsApp and Facebook. When the internet shuts down, its really hard to get ahold of them. Thats what they do, they cut down the internet,"" Arteaga said. Arteaga noted that while the pandemic has ravaged an already-faltering healthcare system in Cuba, increased disease, death, and destruction only brought the country to a ""tipping point"" after more than 60 years of abuse. ""People are dying of COVID. People are dying of other conditions and they have to stay at home. They have to keep their dead relatives at home because there are no supplies in the morgues. There are no supplies in the hospitals. The power goes off and the generators in the hospitals dont work and people die,"" he said. ""Everything, infrastructure, everything in Cuba -- its at the lowest limit right now. Thats what were seeing right now, but its always been low. People got tired of it."" President Joe Biden avoided explicitly condemning communism and Marxist ideology in a Monday statement, though he claimed to ""stand with the Cuban people."" Marxism is the philosophical underpinning of communism, the ruling political system in Cuba, and has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people over several decades. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests could have actually been demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" On Wednesday, Psaki again declined to blame unrest in Cuba on communism, Breitbart News reported. ""People want a new system, a democratic system. We have a dictatorship in Cuba, and we have been having that for years and years,"" Arteaga said. ""Thats why people are protesting in the streets in Cuba, and thats why they are giving their lives in Cuba to the hands of the police and the army. They want a radical change in the government of Cuba."" American corporate media also falsely asserted that the protests were a response to the nations handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic or economic woes, even as protesters were caught on camera saying slogans such as, ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. ""I dont understand why theres been so much silence on the left on this particular point with regard to whats happening. We can talk about the vice president, Kamala Harris, going down to Guatemala and places like that where shes not wanted, supposedly to address the root cause of immigration issues, when we have a humanitarian crisis 45 minutes away from here, and theres been utter silence,"" said Drew-Montez Clark, a U.S. Representative candidate for District 25 in Florida. ""We need to call [communism] for what it is. ... We have the radical left in this country that wants to move toward that authoritarianism. They want to move toward socialism and communism. But we have a perfect example in Cuba of what that turns into,"" Clark continued, as he waved an American flag at the Tuesday protest. Many in the crowd, some who braved dangerous waters in flimsy rafts to escape communism in Cuba, expressed the same concerns about the direction of the United States. ""I would say to all of you: communism sounds pretty when you talk about it if you want to promote it,"" Arteaga said. ""You can read it in a book and it is beautiful,"" Alvarino joined in. ""But in real life, it is suffering. It degrades a society. It oppresses the ones that are not on top, the ones that are not part of the [leadership.],"" Arteaga continued. ""Coming from a communist country, I can tell you, thats the last thing you want for a country like America. Thats what many countries in the world are trying to fight against."" Arteaga said Americans must be very watchful of the government and the culture to make sure communism does not gain a foothold in the United States. ""Dont believe the good things they say about communism. Its not real,"" he concluded. ""This country is beautiful the way it is okay? Dont change it,"" Alvarino added. ""We are working good -- this is the best country in the world. So, God Bless America.""",

"Cuba Protests: 5,000 Arrested, Police Target Religious Leaders",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/14/cuba-protests-arrested-police-target-religious-leaders/,07/14/21,www.breitbart.com,"Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people since protests against communism erupted in Cuba on Sunday, a total including those known to be under investigation but not the disappeared. The human rights group Cuban Prisoners Defenders submitted a list of 162 people to the United Nations on Wednesday suspected of being the victims of forced disappearances, meaning their families have reported them missing, but police have not confirmed their arrest. Cuban police regularly detain individuals perceived to be opposed to the Communist Party for participating in peaceful protests, practicing journalism, or being involved with religious groups not controlled by the Party. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights, a non-governmental organization, revealed in a report published this month that Cuba has enacted over 30,000 arbitrary arrests against perceived dissidents in the last five years. Protests erupted in Cuba on Sunday calling for an end to the communist regime. The protests attracted thousands of people in nearly every major city in the country - spanning the entire island - and prompted Cuban police to respond by opening fire on protesters, beating them publicly, using attack dogs to maul them, and otherwise violently repressing them. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who represents the public face of the Castro family regime, also called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. The Cuban independent news outlet 14 y Medio reported on Wednesday that it could confirm, citing civil society organizations, ""over 5,000 people imprisoned or under investigation"" as a direct result of Sundays protests, among them a disproportionate number of journalists and pro-democracy activists. It noted that the regimes internet shutdown made it much more difficult to communicate across the island, so there are likely a high number of others who participated in protests but remain incommunicado or whose relatives have not been able to reach journalists to report them missing. Cuban citizens throughout the country have also expressed concerns over the potential deaths of their loved ones. Reports on social media suggest that hospitals are not allowing family members to visit patients in the hospital recovering from bullet wounds, leaving unclear their health status. The communist regime admitted to one death during the protests on Wednesday, a man identified as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda. Authorities did not reveal a cause of death in his case. The statement in which the Ministry of Interior revealed the death also accused protesters of attempting to attack a police station. In addition to targeting journalists and members of known civil society groups, Cuban regime agents have assaulted and detained religious leaders. The most prominent case so far of such an assault occurred in Camaguey where Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, a Catholic priest who had prominently criticized the regime, received a public beating before going missing for nearly 24 hours. Alvarez resurfaced late Monday after an international campaign demanding to know his whereabouts. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) documented several other targeted attacks on religious leaders on the island in a statement on Tuesday. ""Those reported as detained include Yeremi Blanco and Yarian Sierra, two pastors from the Berean Baptist Mission in Matanza and Reverend Yusniel Perez Montejo of the Eastern Baptist Convention,"" USCIRF noted. ""Cuban authorities are detaining religious leaders merely for peacefully protesting and calling for greater respect for human rights,"" USCIRF Commissioner James W. Carr said in a statement. ""Principal among human rights concerns in Cuba are the ongoing and systematic violations of religious freedom, which include the persistent intimidation and harassment of religious leaders."" The Global Liberty Alliance, a group that does extensive legal work to protect the faithful on the island, also shared reports on Tuesday that members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, or Free Yorubas, also went missing during the protests. The Yoruba are a Nigerian ethnic group; Cuban Yorubas are practitioners of a hybrid Cuban religion that blends Yoruba paganism with Spanish Catholicism known commonly as santeria. The Cuban regime heavily regulates santeria and persecutes those who practice it outside of the auspices of Party-approved priests. The Global Liberty Alliance denounced on Tuesday that members of the Free Yorubas reported and outsized police presence outside of the residences of some of the most prominent members.  ALERT GLA has received word that the #FreeYorubas of #Cuba may be under arrest. The Free Yorubas report that 3 police vans have arrived to arrest up to 15 people sheltering in a home. @USCIRF pic.twitter.com/U0P2VaAZ8c -- The Global Liberty Alliance (@GLALegalDefense) July 12, 2021 As of Wednesday, the Global Liberty Alliance also reported the disappearance of a Methodist pastor, Carlos Raul Macias Lopez, and his family. While Christians on the island face significant persecution, the Vatican has not yet issued any substantive statement on the protests or the state violence in response to them as of Wednesday. Pope Francis has visited Cuba with the blessing of the Communist Party, receiving praise from Fidel Castro. Most Christians remaining in Cuba identify as Catholic. The Conference of Catholic Bishops of Cuba issued a statement on Tuesday stopping short of condemning the government for the wave of violence it unleashed on its people. ""We understand that the government has responsibilities and has tried to take measures to improve the difficulties [faced by the country],"" the statement read in part, ""but we also understand that the people have a right to manifest their needs, desires, and hopes and, at the same time, publicly express how some measures taken are seriously affecting them.""

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, July 14 (Reuters) - Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on the amount of food and medicine travelers could bring into the country in an apparent small concession to demands by protesters who took to the street last weekend. Thousands joined a wave of nationwide protests over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections on Sunday, in the most significant unrest in decades in the Communist-run country. The government blamed the unrest on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardship caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo that Washington tightened in the midst of the pandemic, pushing the Cuban economy to the brink. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Several countries and the United Nations have called on the government to respect citizens' right to express themselves. Others like Mexico have said the best way to help the Cuban people would be for the United States to ease sanctions. loading In Cuba, a growing number of high-profile artists from salsa band Los Van Van to jazz pianist Chucho Valdes have criticized the authorities handling of the unrest, urging them to listen to protesters rather than fight them. Intermittent internet outages that activists say were designed to tamp any further unrest eased slightly on Wednesday although access to social media and messaging services remained restricted. Officials have blamed a campaign on social media under the hashtag #SOSCuba calling for humanitarian aid for fueling the protests, saying it was launched by U.S.-backed mercenaries seeking to destabilize the Communist-run country. They compared the push to a U.S.-backed effort to send relief to Venezuela in 2019 that ended in a violent standoff on the Colombian border. loading Still, one of the campaign's demands was for the government to lift customs restrictions on food, medicine and hygiene products that are lacking in the country amid its worst economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union. And Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said on Wednesday the government would do precisely that from next Monday, lifting restrictions until the year-end. ""It was a demand made by many travelers and it was necessary to take this decision,"" he said on a roundtable on state television, alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel. It was not immediately clear how much difference the move would make given that there are very few flights at the moment into the Caribbean island nation which is going through its worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic. Government critic Yoani Sanchez, who runs news website 14ymedio, was quick to tweet that such concessions would not be enough to appease those who had protested on Sunday. ""We do not want crumbs, we want freedom, and we want it nowwwww,"" she wrote. ""The streets have spoken: we are not afraid."" Cubans say they have been frustrated by outages in mobile internet and restricted access to social media and messaging platforms since Sunday. ""It's been a bunch of days that noone has been able to connect,"" said Havana resident Andrea Lopez. ""My husband is in Mexico and I haven't been able to speak with him."" More than 200 people were detained during or following the protests, according to exiled rights group Cubalex, and only a handful have been released so far. Diaz-Canel said there were three kinds of protesters; counter-revolutionaries, criminals and those with legitimate frustrations. State-run television showed images of a crowd looting a store and another attacking an empty police car. Interior ministry officials said in a program televised later that some of the detained would be pursued for crimes like incitement to violence, contempt, robbery and damage to public property, which carry lengthy prison sentences.

Cuba's president says government has some blame for protests,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/cubas-president-government-blame-protests-78855031,07/15/21,abcnews.go.com,"Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has acknowledged shortcomings in his governments handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he is urging Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to violence during recent street protests HAVANA -- Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday acknowledged shortcomings in his government's handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he urged Cubans to not act with hate -- a reference to violence during recent street protests. Until now, the Cuban government had only blamed social media and the U.S. government for the weekend protests, which were the biggest seen in Cuba since a quarter century ago, when then-President Fidel Castro personally went into the streets to calm crowds of thousands furious over dire shortages following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its economic subsidies for the island. In a nighttime address on state television, Diaz-Canel for the first time was self critical and acknowledged that failings by the state played a role in the protests over food shortages, rising prices and other grievances. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" In the protests, many Cubans expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages. Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against the coronavirus. But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades. Police moved in and arrested dozens of protesters, sometimes violently, and the government has accused protesters of looting and vandalizing shops. Smaller protests continued Monday and officials reported at least one death. No incidents were reported Wednesday. ""Our society is not a society that generates hatred and those people acted with hatred,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""The feeling of Cubans is a feeling of solidarity and these people carried out these armed acts, with vandalism ... yelling for deaths ... planning to raid public places, breaking, robbing, throwing stones."" Authorities did not report the number of people arrested, Col. Moraima Bravet of the Interior Ministry said Wednesday only that they are mostly between the ages of 25 and 37 and will be prosecuted such crimes as public disorder, assault, contempt, robbery or damage. Cuba is suffering its worst crisis in years from a combination of the coronavirus pandemic that has paralyzed its economy, including the vital tourism industry, inefficiencies in the state-run economy and the tightening of U.S. sanctions on the island. The administration of President Donald Trump imposed more than 200 measures against the island in four years. Diaz-Canel said that this ""complex situation"" was taken advantage of ""by those who do not really want the Cuban revolution to develop or a civilized relationship with respect with the United States."" Shortly before the presidents remarks, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced some measures such as customs flexibility for Cuban citizens who go on foreign trips to bring home toiletries, food and medicines, which are among the most hard to find items in Cuba. Marrero also said that work is being done to improve the stability of the national electricity system and that officials will seek to improve the supply of medicines, many of which are produced on the island but whose inputs must be imported. Meanwhile, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil announced the directors of state-owned enterprises will be allowed to determine salaries beyond the regulations. He also said that in the coming weeks long-promised rules will be instituted for small- and medium-size enterprises to be formed, a step once unthinkable under the communist government.",

Miami police officers escorted the group as they walked eastbound on Eighth Street to get to the building that housed the former U.S Cuban Assistance Center from 1962 to 1974. Officers blocked intersections to allow the group to turn northbound toward Biscayne Boulevard. They passed by Bayfront Park, near to where a group of boaters with U.S. and Cuban flags had met earlier. It was a five-mile journey. They arrived at the 17-story Spanish Renaissance-style building at 600 Biscayne Blvd. to continue their protest. Some of the Cuban-American children have heard stories about the exodus. Fidel Castro was imposing communist policies when their ancestors escaped the island with whatever they could carry. The U.S. granted them political asylum and assistance for healthcare and housing. Ad The area where Miami Heat fans now gather before games became known as the ""Ellis Island of the South."" The sudden wave of refugees turned it into the ""Refugio"" camp. Some slept on the floor, as they waited for their turn to be processed. More than half a century later, Cubans who protested on the island Sunday say they are tired of the authoritarian communist regime and they want political change. They are dealing with shortages of food and medicine, power outages, internet connectivity issues, and COVID patients dying at home. Protesters in Miami chanted on their behalf for a ""Free Cuba!"" The dry-foot, wet-foot policy that protected Cubans who arrived by boat is gone. Helping refugees is not the priority it once was during the Cold War. Some of the participants of the Miami march said they want President Joe Biden to help Cubans get rid of communism for good.

"Black Lives Matter blames US, praises Cuban regime, social media erupts",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/black-lives-matter-blames-us-praises-cuban-regime-social-media-erupts,07/15/21,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Black Lives Matter faced fierce criticism late Wednesday after posting a statement that blasted the U.S. and praised Cuba's government while the island was destabilized by historic protests and violent crackdowns. The statement - originally posted on Instagram and later tweeted and retweeted - blamed the U.S. embargo for the country's instability and credited the Cuban government for historically granting ""Black revolutionaries"" asylum. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, was quick to rebuke an initial tweet that linked to the statement. ""The extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in #Cuba,"" Rubio tweeted. CLICK FOR LIVE UPDATES ON CUBA The BLM statement was sent out at about the time Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel admitted in a televised address that his governments failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other issues. He had earlier called on ""revolutionaries"" to counter the anti-government protesters. PITBULL PLEADS FOR HELP FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc.s tweet echoed Diaz-Canels early statements that blamed the U.S. embargo for the countrys economic devastation. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades and is also facing a resurgence of coronavirus cases. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday denied claims that the U.S. was to blame. He said Cuba faces a long list of problems. He said Cubans are tired of living under a mismanaged economy. ""That is what we are hearing and seeing in Cuba, and that is a reflection of the Cuban people, not of the United States or any other outside actor,"" he said. BLM called for the U.S. to lift the sanctions that are ""cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis."" Cuba is being ""punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" the statement read. The group said Cuba has been an ally with ""oppressed peoples of African descent"" and praised the countrys effort to protect ""Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur."" (Shakur, also known as JoAnne Chesimard, was convicted of being an accomplice in the 1973 slaying of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster, who left behind a wife and 3-year-old son. Shakur later escaped prison and fled to Cuba, where former Cuban leader Fidel Castro granted her asylum.) The BLM statement underscores the tense political climate in the U.S. regarding Cuba. Many Republicans and Democrats have been forceful in their support of the anti-government protesters. Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, the son of a Cuban immigrant, took to Twitter on Sunday in support of the thousands of protesters. He posted a video that showed dozens in front of the Communist Party headquarters and said the current regime will be ""consigned to the dustbin of history."" ""It has brutalized & denied freedom to generations of Cubans, and forced my family & so many others to flee,"" he tweeted. ""The American people stand squarely with the men & women of Cuba and their noble fight for liberty."" President Biden also called the protests ""historic"" and a ""clarion call,"" but his detractors say the White House has not gone far enough to support the protesters. The progressive wing of the Democrat Party -- many of whom align themselves with BLM regarding policy -- seem unsure on how to react to the protests, subsequent violent crackdowns and Internet blackouts. BERNIE SANDERS' LONG HISTORY OF PRAISING CUBA'S COMMUNISTS The BLM statement was widely panned on social media. The group did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News shortly after a Politico reporter posted the statement. Giancarlo Sopo, a communication strategist who once worked on former President Trumps re-election campaign, called the tweet ""disgusting."" ""Despite the Cuban dictatorships murdering and beating of protestors (many of them Black), BLMs statement on Cuba...condemns the U.S., praises the Castro regime, and makes no mention of the atrocities being committed by the dictatorship,"" he tweeted. Joe Walsh, the former Illinois Republican, called the statement ""way worse than embarrassing."" Hillel C. Neuer, the Canadian-born international lawyer, tweeted, ""@Blklivesmatter just sided with the oppressors."" The true extent of the countrys crackdown is unclear due to reports of blocked internet access. The New York Times, citing Amnesty International, reported on Tuesday that at least 150 were detained. There were other reports of some protesters being unaccounted for. Last month, for the 29th year, the United Nations General Assembly voted against the six-decade embargo, according to the New York Times. Rodney Hunter, the political coordinator at the U.S. Mission to the U.N., reportedly said the U.S. supports the Cuban people. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Sanctions are one set of tools in our broader effort toward Cuba to advance democracy, promote respect for human rights, and help the Cuban people exercise the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" he said, according to the paper.

The lyrics of ""Patria y Vida,"" Spanish for ""Homeland and Life,"" antagonize a more than half-a-century old Cuban government propaganda slogan. The song urging Cubans to ""no longer shout 'Homeland and death! But, 'Homeland and life!"" took a different meaning on the communist island during the coronavirus pandemic. For Cuban Americans, the lyrics had more meaning after the uprising Sunday. SOS Cuba protesters meet Wednesday in Little Havana to watch Gente De Zona, or GDZ, perform a 'Patria Y Vida' song that became the anthem of the Sunday uprising in Cuba.

W.H.O. Subsidiary Discourages Cuba Protests over Coronavirus,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/w-h-o-susidiary-discourages-cuba-protests-over-coronavirus/,07/15/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), the Americas subsidiary of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), discouraged anti-communist protests in Cuba in a statement Wednesday, claiming they elevate the risk of spreading Chinese coronavirus. PAHOs statement appeared to contradict the W.H.O.s active support of riots in the United States throughout summer 2020 in response to alleged racism in the country. At the time, W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to mass assemblies of people, many of them violent, by asserting that his agency ""fully supports equality and the global movement against racism."" Unlike in summer 2020, however, many countries of the world now have access to experimental vaccines, many of which have shown a significant ability to limit the spread of Chinese coronavirus. The Cuban communist regime claims to have two vaccine candidates in advanced development and began pediatric clinical trials for one of them, the ""Abdala"" experiment, on Thursday. PAHO is currently embroiled in legal litigation over its ties to the Castro regime. Cuban slave doctors forced to work in Brazil sued the agency in 2018 for signing onto an agreement between Cuba and the then-socialist government of Brazil to ship hundreds of doctors to the country. The doctors did not receive payments for their work, they alleged, and the Castro regime forced them to engage in espionage and communist agitation. PAHO signing onto the agreement prevented conservative lawmakers in Brazil from rejecting it and offered a shield to the Brazilian government should the United States take measures in response to Brazil enriching an enemy state. Thousands of Cubans began taking the streets of the island nations biggest cities on Sunday, flooding as many as 60 municipalities across the country with peaceful marches demanding an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. Authorities responded to the protests with violent repression that included reports of opening fire on crowds of protesters, beating them publicly, and, later, door-to-door raids shooting people in their homes and dragging them out to unknown locations. Protests reportedly continued into Wednesday, but Cuban government officials cut off access to social media, making it difficult for citizens to share videos and other images of the protests and corresponding repression. ""The agglomeration of people in protests over political, religious, cultural, or sports reasons increase the risk of transmission and especially if, as in the case of Cuba, there is active transmission in many places around the country,"" PAHOs emergencies director Ciro Ugarte scolded on Wednesday. Ugarte noted that in Matanzas province, east of Havana, doctors claim to have identified the Indian variant of the virus known as ""Delta,"" which is allegedly fueling an ""exponential"" rise in cases. Matanzas has experienced some of the largest protests and most violent police response. Ugartes tone differs from how the W.H.O. responded to the outburst of violent riots around the United States a year ago. ""WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"" W.H.O. chief Tedros said in June 2020. ""We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."" Tedros statement occurred at a time when Cuba was still not experiencing any significant number of cases, but the Castro regime was nonetheless acting in ways that could facilitate the spread of the virus. The Cuban government began actively courting tourism in spring 2020 in response to much of the world locking down and restricting travel, hoping to take financial advantage of the diminution in competition for tourists. The first known cases of Chinese coronavirus in Cuba were documented in Italian tourists from Lombardy, at the time one of the regions with the highest rates of infection in the world. PAHOs discouragement of expressions against the Castro regime recalls its own questionable relationship with the communist government. In 2018, the Spanish online newspaper Diario de Cuba obtained government documents that revealed PAHO to be a party in the creation of Brazils ""Mais Medicos"" program, created by corrupt socialist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to import Cuban slave doctors and enrich the Castro regime. The documents showed that the Brazilian government agreed to pay salaries to the Cuban doctors - revealing the socialists claims that they were aware doctors would only receive meager academic ""stipends"" to be a lie - and that PAHOs involvement allowed Lula to go forward with the plan without consulting the Brazilian Congress, which may have opposed it given the large number of native Brazilian doctors the country counts on. President Jair Bolsonaro, who ended ""Mais Medicos,"" accused the Cuban government of using doctors to build espionage networks in countries that purchased them. Bolsonaro has offered political asylum to any Cuban doctor seeking to defect in recognition that the Cuban regime punishes defectors by banning them from coming home for at least eight years. A group of doctors who escaped the slave program sued PAHO in U.S. court following the revelation of those documents. In November, a U.S. federal court rejected PAHOs attempt to dismiss the lawsuit; it remains ongoing today. Experts estimate that the Castro regime makes about $11 billion a year selling slave doctors to allied countries. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
Cuba lifts customs restrictions on food and medicine after biggest protests in decades,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/americas/cuba-lifts-food-medicine-customs-restrictions-intl/index.html,07/15/21,www.cnn.com,"Havana (CNN) Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on travelers bringing food, medicines and hygiene products into the country in an apparent acknowledgment of demands from anti-government demonstrators . Thousands took to the streets across the island nation last weekend to protest chronic shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a worsening coronavirus outbreak, marking the most significant unrest in decades. The rare wave of demonstrations against the country's communist government has been fanned by a deepening economic crisis worsened by the pandemic. Covid-19 has devastated the country's tourism industry, sending Cuba's economy into a deep slump. People take part in an anti-government demonstration in Havana on July 11. Cubans now spend hours in long lines to buy food and medicine, and lockdowns have left many without work. Driven by desperate conditions, migration is on the rise by both land and sea. Since the start of the 2021 fiscal year, the US Coast Guard reported intercepting around 500 Cubans at sea. In a country known for repressing dissent, the demonstrations have been viewed as remarkable. US President Joe Biden on Monday expressed support for the Cuban people, urging Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel's regime to ""hear their people and serve their needs."" ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Biden said in a statement.

""The Cuban Government has attempted to silence their [Cubans] voices and communications through internet shutdowns, violence, and arbitrary detentions of dozens of protesters, journalists, activists, and other repressive tactics,"" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday, calling on the Cuban government to release anyone detained for peaceful protest.

But, days later, he conceded that the government needed to do more to improve living conditions in poorer neighborhoods that had been rocked by the demonstrations. On Sunday, CNN journalists witnessed multiple people being forcibly arrested and thrown in the back of vans at protests in Havana. Videos of the protest showed demonstrators turning over a police car and throwing rocks at officers. The Cuban government has not said how many people were arrested or injured in the protests. Diaz-Canel said he didn't know the exact figure, but said ""tens of people"" had been injured. In San Antonio de los Banos, a city of about 46,000 people west of Havana, hundreds of Cubans took to the streets on Sunday, fed up after nearly a week of electricity cuts during the sweltering July heat. ""Everyone was in the streets,"" one resident, who did not want to be named, told CNN. ""They have gone six days with only 12 hours of power each day. That was one of the things that blew this up."" Anti-government protesters march in Havana on Sunday. On Wednesday evening, the Cuban government announced it would lift restrictions on food and medicine travelers could bring into the country -- a small concession for demonstrators. Custom duties on these products will not need to be paid, and the relaxed measures will stay in place for the rest of the year. The Cuban government blames its economic woes on the US trade sanctions, which restricts its access to imports and financing. In a recent nationally televised address, Diaz-Canel repeated that criticism and urged his supporters to physically confront protesters. ""The order to combat has been given,"" he said at the end of his appearance on Sunday. ""Revolutionaries need to be on the streets.""",

The protest group -- founded by ""trained Marxists"" -- released a statement that completely ignored the mass calls demanding ""freedom"" from the oppressive Cuban regime as well as widespread reports of police brutality and arrests. Instead, it solely blamed the troubles on the US embargo, calling it a ""cruel and inhumane policy"" that was ""instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government."" ""The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" BLM said in the statement first given to a Politico reporter.

DeSantis calls on Biden to help restore internet access to Cuba as protesters continue to take to streets of South Florida,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/15/cuban-american-protesters-take-to-streets-of-miami-lakes/,07/15/21,www.local10.com,"Drivers honked their horns in support of the Cuban-Americans protesting Thursday morning at the intersection of Northwest 154th Street and Northwest 82nd Avenue in Miami Lakes as the protesters demanded freedom for the Cuban people. MIAMI LAKES, Fla. - Gov. Ron DeSantis made an appearance in South Florida Thursday, alongside other leaders from Miami-Dade County, to call on the Biden administration to help restore internet access to Cuba. ""The one thing communists fear the most is the truth,"" the governor said. Authorities in Cuba blocked social media sites earlier this week in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the beleaguered nation. Restricting internet access has become a tried-and-true method of stifling dissent by authoritarian regimes around the world, alongside government-supported disinformation campaigns and propaganda. DeSantis said it wont be an overnight fix, but said the U.S. is capable of helping restore internet access on the island. #BREAKING: @POTUS is considering tech to help reinstate internet access in #Cuba. Adds hes not reinstating remittances bc he has no faith #Cuban government wont confiscate them.

Ron DeSantis, other leaders hold news conference in Miami amid Cuba protests Ad Earlier in the morning, drivers honked their horns in support of the Cuban-Americans who were protesting at the intersection of Northwest 154th Street and Northwest 82nd Avenue in Miami Lakes as the protesters demanded freedom for the Cuban people. ""Weve suffered for so long and we are here to represent our families and everyone who is still stuck in Cuba who has not been able to have at least the basic necessities of life,"" protest organizer Vanessa Wong said. DeSantis on Thursday praised protesters for remaining peaceful, but said blocking roads and highways, which happened Tuesday on the Palmetto Expressway, will not be tolerated. ""We cant have that,"" he said. But many say the governor is not backing up his words as the Florida Highway Patrol let the busy highway shut down on Tuesday, even though troopers blocked Black Lives Matter protesters from getting on I-95 last year. Ad No arrests were made in either incident. During Thursdays protest in Miami Lakes, no roadways were blocked by demonstrators. ""Its time that we seek a change and we ask for help from our representatives,"" Wong said. The rally comes a day after protesters in Miami marched for 5 miles in a demonstration of unity toward the civil unrest in Cuba. ""Whats going on on the island is really bad,"" one man said. ""If people go online and look for it, youre going to see (it) all. Theyre pulling kids out of houses, how theyre beating up people in the street for no reason."" Gov. Ron DeSantis says protesters in solidarity with Cuba should not block traffic, but praises law enforcement for not arresting anyone despite his own anti-riot bill. Demonstrators on Wednesday began their march at Cafe Versailles in Little Havana. They ended up downtown at the Freedom Tower, a landmark considered the ""Ellis Island of the South"" for its role in the 1960s and 1970s as the U.S. Cuban Assistance Center, which offered relief to refugees who sought political asylum from Fidel Castros regime. Ad ""This is the Freedom Tower, and it represents freedom,"" one man said. ""Most of the people, when they first came here, when the first exiles (came) in the 60s, this is where they came. This is where they came to get their paperwork and stuff done."" Activists say Cubans are tired of the communist-run government and want political change. Theyre dealing with shortages of food, medicine and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as power outages and internet connection problems amid a worsening economy. At the FTX Arena, theres an electronic sign that says ""Libertad,"" which means ""freedom,"" and #SOSCuba, which is the hashtag that protesters both here in South Florida and in Cuba have been using on Twitter in a desperate plea for humanitarian intervention.

BIDEN PRAISES CUBAN PROTESTERS AFTER CUBA PRESIDENT ACCUSES US OF FUNDING DEMONSTRATORS ""There is an ongoing review of our own policies, and as we look at those policies, one of the big factors is ensuring that we are not doing anything to pad the pockets of a corrupt, authoritarian regime,"" Psaki said, adding that the White House is looking closely at ways to ""help in a humanitarian way"" to ""support the voices of the Cuban people."" Psaki went on to call communism a ""failed ideology."" ""We certainly believe that it has failed the people of Cuba,"" Psaki said. ""They deserve freedom, they deserve a government that supports them - whether that is making sure they have health and medical supplies, access to vaccines, or whether they have economic opportunity and prosperity instead - this has been a government, an authoritarian, communist regime that has repressed its people and has failed the people of Cuba."" Psaki went on to note the ""ideology of the government, which has failed, and has led to a failure, a lack of access to economic opportunity, to medical supplies, to COVID vaccines"" are all reasons for the historic protests. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who days ago called on revolutionaries to counter anti-government protesters in the streets, acknowledged on Wednesday night government shortcomings in the lead-up to the unrest in the country. Diaz-Canel, who has been widely criticized for the countrys violent crackdown and internet blackouts, gave a televised address Wednesday night and acknowledged that his government failures played a role in the protests over food shortages and other problems. CUBAN PRESIDENT URGES COUNTRY'S 'REVOLUTIONARY CITIZENS TO COUNTER PROTESTS ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" Historic protests broke out across Cuba on Sunday night. Diaz-Canel, who heads the Communist Party, seemed uninterested in making any concessions. He placed the blame squarely on the U.S. for stoking resentment and called the protesters mercenaries. At one point, he said, ""The order to fight has been given--into the street, revolutionaries!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cuba is facing its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.

Ron DeSantis and other officials pressed the White House on Thursday to support efforts to preserve internet service to antigovernment protesters in Cuba, even advocating the use of giant balloons as floating Wi-Fi hotspots to allow images of dissent to stream unabated from the authoritarian nation. Cuban authorities blocked social media sites in an apparent effort to stop the flow of information into, out of and within the country after thousands of Cubans began taking to the streets last weekend to protest limited access to COVID-19 vaccines and basic goods. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in decades. ""We obviously have to stand with the people of Cuba against the communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said at a press conference in Miami, adding that restoring access to the internet is vital to supporting the people of Cuba. President Joe Biden responded later Thursday by denouncing communism and saying his administration is assessing whether it has the technology to maintain internet access for Cubans. ADVERTISEMENT Internet access was restored in Cuba earlier this week, but, as of Thursday, cellphone data was still not fully restored. The protests in the island nation have sparked an outpouring of support in Florida, which is home to the nations largest community of Cuban exiles. Throngs of people in Miami, Orlando and the Tampa area have rallied in support, sometimes shutting down major thoroughfares. DeSantis said every option should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology to supply internet service. One option being considered is using balloons to provide connectivity. The Republican governor also suggested using the U.S. Embassy in Havana as a kind of hotspot. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another -- also communicate to the outside world -- that truth is going to matter,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted."" Its unclear how the U.S. government or any other entity, public or private, might keep internet service uninterrupted. ""We need the political willingness from the Biden administration,"" said Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, whose parents were Cuban exiles. ""And if the federal government considers that they cannot pay for the resources, the Cuban American community will."" On Thursday evening, Biden denounced Cuba as a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens"" and called communism ""a universally failed system"" during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Biden said that the U.S. is considering ways to help Cubans -- as long as that aid is not undermined by the communist government. ADVERTISEMENT Biden said the administration wont ease a ban on remittances to Cubans because they believe ""it is highly likely the regime would confiscate"" them, and that while the U.S. is prepared to send ""significant amounts"" of a COVID-19 vaccine to the country, theyd have to be administered by an international organization in such a way that average citizens could get them. ""Theyve cut off access to the internet -- were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,"" Biden said. Meanwhile, demonstrations in Florida continued for another day. Hundreds were gathering in Hialeah near Miami to show solidarity with Cubans. Earlier in the week, two Florida men were arrested during a protest in Tampa in support of the demonstrations and were held on charges related to the states new so-called anti-riot law. Julian Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 30, Maikel Vazquez-Pico, 39, were among those arrested Tuesday night as a group of protesters attempted to take over an exit ramp at Interstate 275 and Dale Mabry Highway, which is a major thoroughfare in Tampa. Both were arrested on charges that include battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting law enforcement and taking part in an unlawful assembly that blocked streets or sidewalks, records show. Rodriguez-Rodriguez put an officer into a bear hug as the officer was trying to arrest another protester, according to an arrest report. He then punched an officer in the face, breaking his glasses as the officer tried to arrest him, the report said. He continued to resist arrest until he was placed in handcuffs. The men were being held without bond in the Hillsborough County Jail early Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether either had an attorney who could comment. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into law a Florida bill that boosts penalties against demonstrators who turn violent and creates new criminal penalties for those who organize demonstrations that get out of hand. Provisions of the law also make it a felony to block some roadways and give immunity to people who drive through protesters blocking a road. The bill was introduced after last summers protests for racial justice during which some Black Lives Matter protesters were met by police with tear gas and arrests when they took to the streets for days at a time. During his Thursday press conference, DeSantis again sought to differentiate recent protests over Cuba from those last year. ""Cuban Americans who are out demonstrating,"" he said, ""theyre not violent riots. Theyre out there being peaceful and theyre making their voices heard, and we support them."" But he said demonstrators should not be shutting down roads that could impede traffic and commerce. ___ Calvan reported from St. Petersburg, Florida. Frisaro reported from Fort Lauderdale.

""Equally as important, the world has also lost the ability to see what is happening on the ground as the Cuban people rise in support of freedom,"" he continued, urging the Biden administration to take action: Technology exists to provide Internet access into Cuba remotely, using the innovation of American enterprise and the diverse industries here. Similar to the American efforts to broadcast radio into the Soviet Union during the Cold War in Europe, the federal government has a history of supporting the dissemination of information into Cuba for the Cuban people through Radio & Television Marti, located in Miami. In addition to sending information, however, our efforts must include creating a means for the Cuban people to speak to the world. I urge you to act immediately to provide all necessary authorizations, indemnifications, and funding to American businesses with the capability to provide Internet access for the people of Cuba. Steps must be taken immediately. ""Internet access for the Cuban people is of critical importance as they stand up against the repressive Communist government,"" DeSantis continued. ""In the hands of these brave individuals, such access may be the key to finally bringing democracy to the island.""

Venezuelan Socialist Leader: Cuba Protests Are Euro Cup Celebrations,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/15/venezuelan-socialist-leader-cuba-protests-actually-euro-cup-celebrations/,07/15/21,www.breitbart.com,"Diosdado Cabello, the head of Venezuelas ruling socialist party, stated during a press conference this week that the protests in Cuba do not exist and the footage of them widely broadcast throughout international media is, in reality, Italian fans celebrating the nations Euro Cup victory. Cabello is one of Venezuelas most powerful socialist leaders and widely believed to be the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a multinational cocaine trafficking syndicate. He also hosts a state television propaganda show, Con el Mazo Dando (""Hitting with the Mallet""). Cuban people began nationwide street protests on Sunday demanding an end to the communist regime. Thousands of people have taken the streets since, and reports indicate protests are ongoing as of Thursday in nearly every major city in the country. The Communist Party responded to the protests by issuing an ""order of combat"" demanding that loyalists violently attack anyone considered a dissident if seen on the street. As of Wednesday, thousands are believed to be in police custody or missing for participating in the protests. Despite the Castro regime openly acknowledging that protests are ongoing and blaming them on the United States, Cabello made the case during a press conference on Tuesday that no such assemblies had happened, calling the protests a ""media creation."" ""What happened on social media had nothing to do with reality,"" Cabello said. ""People [were] celebrating the Euro Cup and they put that photo out there as if it were happening in Cuba."" Cabello also claimed that some of the many images of Cubans protesting in clearly identifiable cities within Cuba were Argentines celebrating their victory in the Copa America, the South American equivalent of the Euro Cup. Both are soccer tournaments governed by the regional bodies overseen by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). ""It was in Argentina they were celebrating the America Cup, they took the photo from far away and, with no shame whatsoever, saying 'look at Cuba how it is,"" Cabello claimed: ""Era gente que estaba celebrando la Eurocopa"", se burlo Diosdado Cabello, numero 2 del entorno de Nicolas Maduro, quien expreso su apoyo al regimen cubano. #TodoEstaenLN. pic.twitter.com/QLqi33mPcR -- Diario La Nacion (@LaNacionPy) July 14, 2021 Cabello then repeated what has become the default far-left argument against the protests: the true cause of all suffering in Cuba is not 62 years of communist repression, but mild economic sanctions imposed on Cuba by the United States. ""They dont understand that its 60 years of a blockade for them to now think that five tweets from five influences are going to end the Cuban Revolution,"" Cabello said, offering the Venezuelan regimes ""solidarity, our support, our affection, our respect to the Cuban people and their government for the immense struggle they are undergoing."" Cabellos remarks joined a growing list of far-left South American socialists weighing in to defend the Castro regime. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the former president of Brazil, issued a statement on Twitter dismissing the protests as indistinguishable from protests against leaders in democratic societies. Lulas administration was closely tied to the Castro regime and invested heavily in Cubas slave doctor fundraising system. ""Is what is happening in Cuba so special to be talking so much about it?"" Lula asked on Twitter. ""There was a march. I even saw the president of Cuba at the march, talking to people."" Lula appeared to be referring to Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead president of the Castro regime, organizing a small government-mandated counterprotest on Sunday. ""Im tired of seeing protests against Lula, against [former Brazilian president] Dilma [Rousseff], against Trump ... people protest,"" Lula continued, adding that were it not for U.S. sanctions on Cuba, the country ""would be a Holland"" and that violence against black Cubans on the part of the police, unlike in America, was not happening. The same day Lula made these remarks, a video surfaced from Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba, showing police beating and shooting a man in his home, in front of his twin two-year-olds, and dragging him away, leaving a pool of blood. The man was later identified as Daniel Cardenas, a black man who had marched peacefully on Sunday. While Latin American socialists - and American far-left groups - have banded behind the Castro regime, the administration of President Joe Biden has done little in response to the protests, urging the regime to listen to the protesters but failing to condemn communism for its role in creating the dire circumstances in which the vast majority of Cubans live. The Biden administration has repeatedly claimed that the protests are a response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested this week that Cuban protesters chanting ""freedom"" were actually calling for ""freedom from COVID [Chinese coronavirus],"" not freedom from communism. The Biden administration lifted sanctions on Venezuelas oil industry Monday, despite Venezuelas close economic ties to the Castro regime. The new rules allow ""all transactions and activities related to the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of liquefied petroleum gas to Venezuela,"" giving a lifeline to the state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Sanctions on individual Venezuelan socialist regime leaders, including Diosdado Cabello, remain in vigor. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

"BLM Openly Supports Communism in Cuba, Slams U.S. Embargo",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/15/blm-trashed-supporting-communism-cuba-condemning-inhumane-treatment/,07/15/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) organization defended police brutality by Cubas communist regime -- a regime estimated to have killed tens of thousands of its own people - in a social media post on Thursday responding to nationwide protests on the island. In the Thursday post, BLM blamed U.S. government sanctions and Americas alleged ""inhumane treatment"" of Cubans for crippling the country. Then, BLM asserted Cubans have chosen their own government and that support for pro-democracy dissidents inhibits their right to self-determination. ""This cruel and inhuman policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis,"" the post reads. (Emphasis added). In reality, communist dictator Fidel Castro took over the country in a violent siege in 1959, despite never having won an election. Fidel, his successor and brother Raul, and current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel have all not stood in any election since 1959, despite being the nations only leaders in those 62 years. BLM continued: The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination. Unites States leaders have tried to crush this Revolution for decades. Instead of international amity, respect, and goodwill, the U.S. government has only instigated suffering for the countrys 11 million people - of which 4 million are Black and Brown. (emphasis added). BLM further claimed the Cuban government has supported oppressed people and touted the governments protection of ""Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur,"" an American citizen named Joanne Chesimard who was convicted of killing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1977. Shakur escaped from prison in 1979 and received ""political"" asylum in Cuba in 1984, Breitbart News reported. BLMs post comes four days after protests began in Cuba on Sunday. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in more than 40 municipalities calling for the end of communism. Protesters were caught on camera yelling slogans like ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. Notably, protesters were seen cloaked in American flags, embracing the United States rather than condemning it for its alleged embargo. Even though BLM claims to be against police brutality, especially against black people, the organization did not mention the atrocities being documented on video throughout Cuba at the hands of police. Since protests began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten people in the streets, a large number of them Afro-Cubans. Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people since protests, Breitbart reported. Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. At the end of its post, BLM called for the end to the U.S. embargo on Cuba and alleged the U.S. has ""instigated suffering"" by ""cutting off food, medicine and supplies."" The U.S. embargo policy on Cuba does not prevent the shipment of food, medicine, or any humanitarian aid. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, ""Cubans import more than $2 billion in agricultural products annually, with $150 million of those sales coming from the U.S. Cuba also receives millions in foreign aid from the U.S. every year."" As far as travel goes, in 2019, nearly 500,000 people traveled from the US to Cuba, compared to more than 638,000 in 2018, CNN reported. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who is Cuban-American, has been very vocal about his support of the Cuban people -- especially in light of an unenthusiastic response from the U.S. federal government. Explaining the issue of trade with Cuba, he said of the embargo during a Tuesday speech on the Senate floor: You can open up all you want. We can pass a bill here that says, ""Open to Cuba. A hundred percent open."" Full free trade, you can do whatever you want. At the end of the day, the Cuban regime will control that opening. Its not just what we want to do, its what they want to do. ...They will use any opening as a tool -- as a weapon -- against their people, because thats what socialism does...Thats what these Marxists do in Cuba. They will use anything as a weapon against the people of Cuba. BLM was founded by leaders trained in Marxism, which is the philosophical underpinning of communism. Communism, which is the ruling political system in Cuba, has resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people around the world over several decades. One of the groups founders, Opal Tometi, is also an open supporter of Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro. Maduro has presided over one of the worlds most repressive regimes since 2013 when his predecessor Hugo Chavez died. Under Maduro, Venezuelan police forces have committed a long list of human rights atrocities including the torture, kidnapping, rape, and killing of unarmed protesters. ""Tometi also served as an election observer in socialist Venezuela during the 2015 legislative elections. She praised the socialist dictatorship as 'a place where there is intelligent political discourse on Twitter during one of the bloodiest years of police brutality in the country,"" Breitbart News reported.",

Lonergan: Cuban Protests Reveal Biden's Border Hypocrisy,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/15/lonergan-cuban-protests-reveal-bidens-border-hypocrisy/,07/15/21,www.breitbart.com,"Six months into what has quickly become the most partisan, chaotic and dysfunctional presidency in modern American history, some undeniable truths are starting to emerge. One is that, while the Biden administration can depend on their fellow travelers in the U.S. media to spin domestic news to their benefit, they are helpless when international events occur that expose this White Houses duplicity and incompetence. This was on display last month during Kamala Harriss train wreck of a mission to Guatemala. She was greeted with protesters telling her to go home. The president of Guatemala called out the administration for worsening the border crisis, and Harris looked evasive and unserious when confronted with even softball questions by media allies. It is happening again as a result of recent events in the Caribbean. The president of Haiti was assassinated in his home, leading one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere into further instability. At the same time, citizens in Cuba rose up in perhaps the most public protests ever against the repressive, ossified communist regime that has been in power since 1959. It was a golden opportunity for an American president to support the Cuban people who are bravely standing up to tyranny. Instead we got the hapless, embattled Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas announcing that, while he supports the Cuban people, anyone from Cuba or Haiti attempting to sail the Straits of Florida to seek asylum in the U.S. would be sent back by the Coast Guard. The irony of the statement was thick, as Mayorkas emigrated from Cuba to the U.S. with his family in 1960. Since the passage of the Refugee Act in 1980, it has been American policy that anyone seeking asylum in the U.S. via the sea would be denied. This came after the Vietnamese boat people in the mid-1970s and those in the Mariel boatlift in 1980 overwhelmed U.S. port cities and immigration officials. The policy was enacted for legitimate reasons, but it raises a glaring question. If it is okay to protect South Florida coastal cities from being deluged with Cubans and Haitians, why has this administration abandoned such security concerns at our southern land border by allowing untold numbers of migrants to overwhelm communities from California to the Rio Grande Valley? Cubans who would sail to Florida will be sent back, but those who might venture to the Yucatan peninsula and walk across the border would be welcomed? The two policies are wildly inconsistent. A motive, as always seems to be the case with this administration, may be found in partisan politics. Bidens Democratic Party has fully embraced the idea that those fleeing the poverty of Central Americas Northern Triangle will make ideal Democrat voters in the near future. That explains why talking points from the left focus on the humanitarian obligation of America to allow entry to all those fleeing hardship in developing countries. Cuba, however, is a different case altogether. Since before JFK referred to it as ""that imprisoned island"" in his 1962 Cuban missile crisis address to the nation, Cubans have been living under the boot of the thuggish Castro regime and its current descendants. The regimes adherence to Soviet-style communism condemned generations of Cubans to grinding poverty, atrocious living conditions and denial of the most basic human rights. Most of those who managed to escape the island became staunch anti-communists who tended to vote Republican and have helped make Florida the right-leaning state it is today. Because of this, the left has largely acted as if the recent protests in Cuba never happened. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the self-appointed conscience of the Congress, devout socialist and advocate for oppressed people worldwide, said absolutely nothing about Cuba on her widely read Twitter account. Its bad enough that Cuban refugees tend to vote Republican. That they can speak with first-hand experience to the horrors of communism is apparently unforgiveable. Make no mistake, if there was a good chance that Cubans would make loyal Democrats, AOC, her ""Squad"" comrades and the Biden administration would advocate passionately how we have a moral obligation to rescind the Refugee Act right now and allow daily flotillas of Cubans into Miami. While our country is currently polarized along ideological lines, most people with a grounding in common sense could agree that we should have an immigration policy that is based not on fringe partisan politics, but simply what is in the best interests of America and its citizens first. If we are ever to break free of this administrations tone-deaf, hyper-political mismanagement, it will be required for those people to make their voices heard en masse. Brian Lonergan is director of communications at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, a public interest law firm working to defend the rights and interests of the American people from the negative effects of mass migration.",

Other top Florida officials including Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nunez, Republican Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar and Carlos Gimenez, and FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr joined DeSantis calls and held a joint press conference Thursday to plead with the president to take action. ""We are seeing on the island of Cuba people fighting against a communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said. ""A free Cuba is a noble cause.

Thousands of Cubans on Sunday staged the biggest anti-government protests in decades to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Dozens of activists were detained.

Before the protests, Biden's aides had been looking at a range of options, including easing the flow of remittances to Cuba and authorizing more family travel. Also under consideration has been whether to lift the designation of Cuba as a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" a label Trump gave to Havana days prior to leaving office.

BLM called for the U.S. to lift the sanctions that are ""cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis."" Like Ocasio-Cortez, fellow Democrats have parroted Cubas communist governments own talking points, blaming the U.S., rather than the communist government for its plight. Many have called on President Joe Biden to end the decades-long embargo on the country. The U.S. imposed the embargo after Fidel Castro overthrew the U.S.-backed regime of Batista in 1959. Since then, presidential administrations have renewed the embargo, which is intended to isolate Cuba economically and diplomatically. BIDEN CALLS CUBA A 'FAILED STATE, CONSIDERS US TECH OPTION TO SEND INTERNET SERVICES Former President Barack Obama attempted to normalize relations with Cuba during his second term. Those policies were reversed under President Donald Trump, who imposed new sanctions. Last month, the United States voted against a U.N. resolution that overwhelmingly condemned the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba for the 29th year.

"Activists, lawyers see 'double standard' in Florida's response to Cuba demonstrations",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/activists-lawyers-see-double-standard-florida-s-response-cuba-demonstrations-n1274120,07/15/21,www.nbcnews.com,"When demonstrators took to the streets of Florida this week to show solidarity with anti-government protesters in Cuba, shutting down a major stretch of an expressway and blocking streets in cities across the state, some eyes turned to Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis, a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, signed into law a measure that ramps up penalties against demonstrators this year -- including a provision that makes it a felony to jam some roadways during protests. HB 1, dubbed the ""anti-riot law"" by supporters, was introduced during last summer's protests for racial justice in the wake of the death of George Floyd, when some law enforcement officers arrested Black Lives Matter protesters or sprayed them with tear gas. But as protesters rallied in Miami, Tampa and Orlando this week, officers generally appeared to exercise restraint, reportedly making only a handful of arrests. In the eyes of David Winker, a defense lawyer who has represented Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the double standard was clear. ""I applaud the police for using discretion and not arresting everybody, but I want that same energy carried forward when the protesters have more melanin in their skin,"" Winker said, adding that he opposes HB 1 and supports the anti-government movement in Cuba. ""The double standard has been exposed because DeSantis specifically mentioned the issue of closing roads"" when he signed HB 1 in April, Winker said. Winker was referring to DeSantis' vow that there would be ""swift penalties"" for protesters who shut down traffic. ""You're driving home from work and all of a sudden you have people out there shutting down a highway,"" DeSantis said. ""We made sure that didn't happen in Florida. They start doing that, and there needs to be swift penalties. That's something that just cannot happen."" Demonstrators block Palmetto Expressway in Miami, on July 13, 2021 during a rally to support Cuban protesters. Eva Marie Uzcategui / AFP - Getty Images The text of the law itself, formally known as the Combating Public Disorder Act, prohibits people from ""willfully obstructing the free, convenient, and normal use of any public street, highway, or road"" and makes violators subject to $15 traffic citations. The law includes other measures that have drawn criticism in Florida, including boosted penalties against demonstrators who turn violent and new criminal penalties for those who organize demonstrations that get out of hand. HB 1 also grants legal immunity to people who drive through protesters blocking roads. The American Civil Liberties Union has condemned HB 1. In a statement in April, Micah Kubic, the executive director of the organization's Florida chapter, excoriated what he said were the true motivations behind the law. ""Let's be clear: this is not an anti-riot bill, regardless of what supporters claim. It is a bill that criminalizes peaceful protest, and the impact HB1 will have on Floridians cannot be disputed. Each and every provision harkens back to Jim Crow,"" Kubic said.. The anti-government movement in Cuba, driven in part by fury over poor economic conditions, has in recent days riveted much of Florida, which is home to a large and vibrant Cuban population that traditionally sides with the Republican Party in presidential elections. The demonstrations over Cuba have not been entirely calm. Tampa police arrested three men involved in a demonstration at Al Lopez Park, two of whom were charged with battery on a law enforcement officer, according to a police statement. In remarks from Miami on Tuesday, DeSantis appeared to dismiss comparisons between the movement for Black lives and the demonstrations over the situation in Cuba. ""These are people that are rebelling against a communist dictatorship,"" DeSantis said, adding that the demonstrations across Miami were ""fundamentally different than what we saw last summer."" But some Floridians linked with the Black Lives Matter movement say DeSantis' public rhetoric is an example of hypocrisy. ""When they protest for regime change, which aligns with the governor's political viewpoint ... you see no enforcement from law enforcement,"" Michael Sampson, who co-founded the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, told The Associated Press. A demonstrator addresses the riot police blocking the entrance to I-195 during a Black Lives Matter protest on June 5, 2020. Adam DelGiudice / SOPA Images/Sipa USA via AP ""I think it's just downright hypocrisy we're seeing from the governor and even law enforcement in how they're applying this law. It goes to show how our fears that we had earlier ... that it will be used against Black people fighting for equal rights,"" Sampson said. DeSantis' spokeswoman, Christine Pushaw, commented in a tweet from her personal account Wednesday. ""The Left and aligned corporate media love authoritarianism. Therefore, they are FURIOUS that the Governor of Florida didn't personally drive 500 miles down the state to arrest people for protesting (not rioting) against the communist regime in Cuba,"" Pushaw tweeted. In an email, Pushaw said in part that DeSantis signed HB 1 to ""empower law enforcement in their own jurisdictions, giving local and state law enforcement agencies another tool in their toolbox to protect and serve the people of Florida."" ""The legislation protects First Amendment freedoms, while ensuring that law enforcement professionals are empowered to use their discretion to maintain public safety,"" she said. ""The Governor has always urged all Floridians exercising their right to protest, to make their voices heard peacefully and lawfully."" She said that blocking or obstructing roadways without a permit ""has long been illegal"" under Florida law and that law enforcement agencies across the state have ""discretion to enforce Florida law in a manner that ensures the safety of all motorists and pedestrians."" State Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat, told The Miami Herald that he believes HB 1 should be repealed. Jones, who is Black, told the newspaper that the possibility that the law was not being broadly enforced this week indicates that it was ""geared toward people who look like me."" The debate parallels the one that followed the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, when social justice activists questioned whether the law enforcement response would have been the same had the pro-Trump demonstrators predominantly been Black or brown people.",
Biden facing mounting pressure from all sides to respond to Cuba protests,https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/biden-facing-pressure-from-all-sides-to-respond-to-cuba-protests/,07/15/21,nypost.com,"President Biden is facing mounting political pressure to respond to the anti-government protests breaking out across Cuba, with Republicans urging the administration to take a stronger stance in support of the protesters, and some Democrats calling on the president to seize on the upheaval for a political opportunity.

During Thursdays White House press briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki declared that ""Communism was a failed ideology, and we certainly believe that it has failed the people of Cuba."" ""They deserve freedom,"" Psaki added before going on to say that Biden had ""made clear that he stands with the Cuban people and their call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of repression and economic suffering to which theyve been subjected by Cubas authoritarian regime."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the Cuban protesters are fed up with decades of ""socialist tyranny "" and deserve US support.  ""Theyve had enough of a regime thats stolen their dreams for decades, theyve had enough of its stranglehold on information and on prosperity, theyve had enough of its intimidation and its repression,""  McConnell said in a Senate floor speech on Thursday. He then accused Democrats of ""running interference for the Cuban regime."" People attend a pro-government rally in Havana, Cuba, July 11, 2021.

They still buy the propaganda that Cuba is a socialist paradise, with a model health care and education system that we should actually emulate ,"" the Kentucky Republican said.    Rubio urged the Biden White House to take a more forceful approach to the situation and reach out to the United Nations and the Organization of American States, to get the international community to condemn and isolate Cubas government for its actions -- or face the consequences. ""A horrific bloodbath is what awaits if action is not taken,"" Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. ""So far the response has been weak, weak. Why?"" Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged the White House to take the lead on providing internet access to Cuba after the Havana regime shut down social media sites at the height of the protests. ""The Cuban people have lost their ability to communicate with one another, and many Floridians born in Cuba have no information on the safety of their loved ones,"" DeSantis wrote in a letter to the president Wednesday. ""Equally as important, the world has also lost the ability to see what is happening on the ground as the Cuban people rise in support of freedom."" At a news conference in Miami Thursday, the governor said every option to supply internet service should be explored, including using offshore and satellite technology and converting the US Embassy in Cuba to a kind of hotspot. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth. And if were able to help Cubans communicate with one another -- also communicate to the outside world -- that truth is going to matter. That truth, I think, will be decisive,"" DeSantis said. ""And so, Mr. President, nows the time to stand up and be counted."" At a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday afternoon, Biden said the administration was ""considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access."" But Democrats in Southern Florida are urging the president to take advantage of the protests in Cuba -- and boost his standing among Cuban-Americans, who supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

MIAMI - New videos from Cuba show special troops moving in and using force, and authorities shooting into the distance, likely dispersing crowds. On Cuban state-run TV, the Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel was somewhat apologetic to those who were accidentally hurt in the protests. He also admitted shortcomings in the way his government has handled country-wide shortages. It appears that the Cuban government is also feeling the pressure, announcing they will temporarily lift restrictions on food and medicine travelers can take into the island.

Biden: Cuba 'a failed state' and is 'repressing their citizens',https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/15/biden-cuba-a-failed-state-and-is-repressing-their-citizens,07/15/21,www.aljazeera.com,"And as Haiti decends into chaos after the assassination of its president, Biden says he is not sending US troops there. United States President Joe Biden, facing twin crises close to his countrys borders, on Thursday declared Cuba ""a failed state"" and said sending US forces into Haiti is not on his agenda at the moment. Protesters have been demonstrating in Cuba since Sunday as anger has grown about shortages of basic goods, electricity and internet outages, curbs on civil liberties and the governments handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections. The hardships are exacerbated by a decades-old US trade embargo that is being reviewed by Bidens administration. ""Cuba is, unfortunately, a failed state and repressing their citizens,"" Biden said Thursday at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House. Amid calls from Republicans and Bidens fellow Democrats to restore internet services to Cuba, Biden said his administration is looking into it. ""Theyve cut off access to the internet. Were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access,"" Biden said. Meanwhile, there have been calls for the US to send troops to Haiti after President Jovenel Moise was shot dead early on July 7 at his Port-au-Prince home by what Haitian authorities describe as a unit of assassins, including 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans. The assassination has pitched the already troubled Caribbean nation into chaos, coming amid a surge in gang violence that has displaced thousands and hampered economic activity in the poorest country in the Americas. Biden made it clear that the US is ""only sending American marines to our embassy"" for security purposes. ""The idea of sending American forces into Haiti is not on the agenda at this moment."" Biden-Merkel meet Biden welcomed Merkel to the White House Thursday to discuss disagreements about Russia and China as the two leaders seek to strengthen a relationship that suffered under former President Donald Trump. The US and Germany are key NATO allies. Biden and Merkel have known and worked with each other for years. But their two governments are at odds over a host of tough issues, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, which Washington fears will hurt Ukraine and increase European reliance on Russian gas. They also disagree about the wisdom of partnering with China on business projects, restrictions on travel to the United States from Europe, and Germanys opposition to temporary patent waivers aimed at speeding up COVID-19 vaccine production. On the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, ""They didnt resolve their differences, specifically, the United States came into this meeting knowing this was going to be a friction point between the two leaders and it appears they didnt find any common ground,"" Al Jazeera White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett said. US President Joe Biden holds a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, July 15, 2021 [Tom Brenner/Reuters] Merkel told reporters that Germany, Europes biggest economy, has different views on the pipeline from the US. But she said Berlin viewed Ukraine as a transit country, evidently meaning she believed that natural gas should still flow through Ukraine, even if the pipeline is completed. Merkel said there are a ""number of instruments"" that Europe can take, including sanctions, if Russia does not meet commitments to Ukraine on the pipeline. Russia says the $11bn pipeline, led by state energy company Gazprom and its Western partners, will be completed later this year. Biden said that ""good friends can disagree"" on a project such as Nord Stream 2 and that both leaders have asked their teams to look at practical measures the countries can take on the pipeline if Ukraines energy security is weakened. Biden, 78, and Merkel, 66, see eye to eye on a string of broader issues, and both want to strengthen the transatlantic relationship that suffered under Trumps frequent, withering criticism of close US allies. Merkel, chancellor since 2005, plans to exit Germanys government after national elections in September, meaning she is likely to be seen as a ""lame duck"" in her final months in power. Polling shows her Christian Democrats are poised to take the lead in forming a government after the election, but it remains unclear which parties would be included in a coalition. Bidens Democratic Party has tenuous majorities in the US Congress that could evaporate in the 2022 congressional elections. Merkels White House visit - the first by a European leader since Biden took office in January - showed the US was trying to make amends with an ally that had often been attacked during the Trump years.",

""This cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cubas current crisis.""

Cuba's mass protests are driven by the misery of COVID and economic sanctions,https://theconversation.com/cubas-mass-protests-are-driven-by-the-misery-of-covid-and-economic-sanctions-164505,07/16/21,theconversation.com,"Cuba has recently riven by what the BBC has referred to as ""the biggest protests in decades"". What appear to be largely spontaneous outpourings of anger at the hardship faced by many people are being blamed on a severe downturn in the economy, which contracted by 11% last year and has continued to slump in 2021. The protests reflect popular frustration arising from worsening shortages, growing queues and recent power cuts. You can listen to more articles from The Conversation, narrated by Noa, here. Like other tourism-dependent economies, Cuba has suffered a severe shock as a result of the closure of borders due to COVID-19. In 2019 tourism accounted for 20% of all foreign exchange earnings, and the closure of borders in March 2020 resulted in a 75% fall in international arrivals for the year. But Cubas current economic difficulties do not arise only from the pandemic: they are also the result of US policy. Sanctions bite Thanks to US hostility, Cuba remains barred from access to emergency international financing from multilateral financial institutions (including the IMF, World Bank or Inter-American Development Bank) that are helping to cushion the blow for its Caribbean neighbours. The country is also suffering from a series of measures introduced during Donald Trumps administration to tighten US sanctions. Starting in 2017 and accelerating towards the end of his term, these had cut the number of international visitors and curtailed remittances flows. They also interrupted deliveries of oil imports, hampered (and added significant cost to) international trade and deterred foreign investment. Possibly the most damaging single measure, announced as a parting shot by Trump just ten days before he left office in January 2021, was the decision to return Cuba to the US State Departments list of ""state sponsors of terrorism"". At the time this received little attention. It was not heeded by US allies, such as Canada, the EU or the UK, which regard the US allegations as baseless, and continue their official engagement and fruitful collaboration with the Cuban government. But, for international businesses, including financial institutions, the inclusion of Cuba on the list set off warning lights in compliance departments, which bear responsibility for minimising the risk of falling foul of international sanctions. In line with the process of ""derisking"" that has intensified in recent years as the capacity of regulators to identify suspicious transactions has increased, most businesses have refused to engage in transactions involving Cuba. As a result, since January it has become increasingly difficult for any Cuban entities (including those sourcing medical supplies and food) to conduct trade, and almost impossible to arrange financing. COVID cripples In 2020, Cubas performance in terms of containing the spread of COVID-19 was exceptionally positive. But the economic contraction, disease-prevention measures and the diversion of government money towards this effort was already creating severe hardships, with lengthening queues for basic goods and rising prices. EPA-EFE/Ernesto Mastrascusa Then in January, Cuba experienced a second wave, with daily cases rising to an average of around 1,000 until June. And finally, they shot up alarmingly in July, to reach around 6,000. As of July 14, the cumulative death rate of 14.2 per 100,000 remains well below that of the US (now at at 182), but the daily number of deaths has reached 50. One of Cubas home-produced vaccines has proved over 90% effective in phase 3 trials and the vaccine rollout has begun to bring case numbers down in the capital, Havana, but the pace of production is held back by US sanctions and the spread of the virus at national level remains exponential. The combination of renewed COVID restrictions and diminishing resources have compounded peoples hardships. Also, the inflationary effect of a major currency reform, which aimed to eliminate the dual currency system, on January 1 2021, has added to a sense of insecurity. On top of all this have come power cuts caused by fuel shortages and technical problems. Hardship spreads The suffering has been particularly acute for those dependent on private sector activity. Between 2011 and 2017, around 1 million people - 15% of the working age population - had moved into the non-state sector, registered either as self-employed or as informal workers. State sector workers received substantial pay rises in 2020 and have continued to receive wages (albeit reduced) during the pandemic. But many of those working in the private sector, which had been mainly dependent on the spending of foreign visitors, saw their earnings dwindle as a result of tighter US sanctions and then disappear altogether because of the pandemic, leaving them with only minimal social security. The government has tried to protect the vulnerable and ensure that the basic needs of all Cubans are met, but its capacity to do so has been eroded. It has tried to control the prices of essential items, but growing shortages and rising prices in black markets have compounded the atmosphere of fear and desperation. At the same time, attempts by local authorities to respond to complaints about profiteers by suppressing black markets have brought conflicts. Resentments between Cubans have grown, and tempers are frayed. The protests in Cuba sprang from real economic suffering, and daily frustrations and resentments. Since July 11, the government has introduced new measures in an attempt to placate protesters and signalled a willingness to listen to complaints, although with its limited resources it can do little to ameliorate conditions in the short term. But the US government could do so, simply by reversing the Trump measures: a policy that was promised in the election campaign but has yet to be delivered.",

Failed agricultural and economic policies, combined with US embargo restrictions and other sanctions, and the pandemic, has ordinary Cubans suffering big time. The decision is a tacit admission of the humanitarian crisis facing the country, something the government was unwilling to admit until the massive July 11th protests.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on the US to lift what she called its ""absurdly cruel"" embargo of Cuba Thursday in her first formal statement responding to the ongoing protests that have rocked Havanas Communist regime. ""We are seeing Cubans rise up and protest for their rights like never before,"" Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) began. ""We stand in solidarity with them, and we condemn the anti-democratic actions led by [Cuban] President [Miguel] Diaz-Canel.

The ""Squad"" member went on to call the embargo ""the US contribution to Cuban suffering,"" adding that it ""is absurdly cruel and, like too many other US policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point. I outright reject the Biden administrations defense of the embargo. It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day [sic] people."" Ocasio-Cortezs call to lift the embargo, which has been in place since 1962, echoed that of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who tweeted earlier this week that the embargo had ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people.""

Cuba protests: The economic woes driving discontent,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/7/16/cuba-protests-the-economic-woes-helping-drive-discontent,07/16/21,www.aljazeera.com,"Soaring global food prices and the islands devalued currency -- coupled with longtime shortages of basic goods and the decades-long United States embargo -- helped spark the recent demonstrations. Cubans have taken to the streets in cities across the country over the last week, in a wave of rare public protests to express their frustration with rising prices, falling wages, the United States embargo and the failings of the islands long-standing communist government to address its economic challenges. Cubas coronavirus pandemic-ravaged economy shrank by 11 percent in 2020, the islands economy minister said, the sharpest contraction since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Soaring global food prices this year and the islands devalued currency -- coupled with shortages of basic goods that predate the pandemic -- have fuelled discontent. Both pro- and anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets since Sunday. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the protests on US sanctions, accusing Washington of ""economic asphyxiation"". But he also is acknowledging -- notably for the first time -- that the Cuban governments policies have also played a role. So what are the economic forces behind Cubas latest protests? Heres what you need to know. Anti-government protesters march in Havana, Cuba on Sunday, when hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in several Cuban cities to protest against ongoing food shortages and high prices of foodstuffs [File: Eliana Aponte/AP Photo] Start from the beginning. What kind of economy does Cuba have? Cuba has whats known as a command economy, where government decisions -- not market forces of supply and demand -- largely determines the production, availability and value of goods. Command economies are central features of communist societies, and Cuba has been ruled by its communist party since forces led by Fidel Castro overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista during the Cuban Revolution in 1959. What does a command economy look like? In command economies (also called planned economies), the government controls many of the means of production, while private ownership of industries, property and other resources is significantly limited. Before the Cuban Revolution, a small elite owned much of the islands land, industries and wealth. The revolution was designed to make Cuba a more equal society, and in many ways, it succeeded in that goal. So if it tackled inequality, why is the economy such a mess? Part of the problem is that government control of the majority of industries can lead to inefficiency, bureaucracy and mismanagement. That, in turn, can translate into shortages of goods, higher prices and frustration for citizens. But the US embargo against Cuba has certainly done the islands economy no favours. Tell me about the US embargo. Since 1960, the US -- Cubas neighbour 145km (90 miles) to the north and once major trading partner -- has maintained a trade embargo against the island in an effort to force its communist leaders from power. The embargo, a form of severe economic sanctions, hasnt achieved its goal, but it has made life for ordinary Cubans harder. Medicine, food and all sorts of other goods are in chronically short supply. The embargo has also provided the islands government with ammunition for its claims that its economic woes are the fault of the US. Is the government blaming the embargo for its current economic problems? Partly. In a speech Wednesday, Diaz-Canel slammed the embargo, which Cubans refer to as a ""blockade"", as ""cruel"" and ""genocidal"". But he also acknowledged for the first time that the Cuban governments actions have played a role in peoples discontent. ""We have to gain experience from the disturbances,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition."" In a tweet Thursday, Diaz-Canel said the embargo has made overcoming the islands problems harder, tweeting that ""the blockade surpasses any desire, it delays us, it does not allow us to advance at the speed we need"". Has the Cuban government tried to fix the problems its policies have created? On paper. Back in 2011, then-President Raul Castro announced reforms aimed at bringing more market-oriented policies into Cubas state-run economy, including allowing people to set up small businesses and eliminating some of the governments notorious bureaucracy. But 10 years later, the countrys leadership has been slow to enact many of those incremental economic reforms, leading to frustration -- especially given the urgent conditions Cubans are facing right now. What are some of those conditions? The COVID-19 crisis has gutted tourism, cutting off a major source of income for Cubans who work in the industry and a major source of US dollars for the Cuban government. Thats especially bad news right now when surging commodity prices mean the government needs to spend more to import food. Remittances, a lifeline for struggling Cuban families and estimated to total $2bn to $3bn per year, plunged after former US President Donald Trump tightened restrictions on Cuban Americans sending money back to the island. The pandemic has only served to further stifle the flow of remittances. And a shortage of foreign currency and the US embargo have also hit Cuban sugar production hard, with the states sugar monopoly reporting that this years harvest stood at just 68 percent of the countrys planned 1.2 million tonnes, the lowest level since 1908, Reuters news agency reported. What role does the islands weakened currency play in the protests? A big one. At the beginning of this year, the Cuban government formally ended its dual currency system, devaluing its peso for the first time since the 1959 revolution. The Cuban peso, known as the CUP, was created as the islands currency by the first president of the countrys post-revolution Central Bank, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. The CUP has always been used for everyday domestic transactions, and many Cubans are paid their wages in CUPs. But thanks to the US embargo and some of the islands state-run economic policies, the value of Cubas currency evolved to become a tricky issue. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union -- Cubas major ally -- the island allowed people to use the US dollar alongside the CUP starting in 1993. Customers wait in line to enter a grocery store in Havana, Cuba near portraits of the late revolutionary Ernesto 'Che Guevara (right) and the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (left) [File: Natalia Favre/Bloomberg] So do Cubans still use the peso and the dollar? Yes, sometimes. Faced with a cash crunch, the Cuban government reallowed ""dollar stores"" last year that let people buy goods like food, toiletries and electronics with bank cards loaded with US dollars or other foreign currency. That, in turn, let the government snap up those dollars to help deal with its liquidity crisis. But the Cuban government phased out a third currency -- the Cuban convertible peso, known as the CUC -- earlier this year, leading to problems. Whats the deal with CUCs? The Cuban government created the CUC in 2004 for conducting state business and buying goods from abroad after it banned US dollars. It pegged the CUC 1:1 to the greenback and stipulated it couldnt be taken out of the country. Until this year, those working in the tourism sector, for example, were still paid in CUCs, leading to disparities with Cubans paid in CUPs. Thats partly why Cubas government scrapped the CUC. Cubans who worked in the tourism sector have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic and the move to a single currency, as they had been paid in the convertible pesos the government chose to phase out [File: Natalia Favre/Bloomberg] So what happened to all of the CUCs? Cubans had through June to trade in their CUCs for CUPs. But the devaluation of the currency means they lost a significant amount of money in doing so, something that hit private-sector workers who have been paid in CUCs for years -- workers like those in the tourism sector -- particularly hard. It has already been a tough year for those workers, as the coronavirus pandemic significantly curbed tourism and as former US President Donald Trump tightened the US embargo against the island. The US trade embargo has made life more difficult for the Cuban people [File: Natalia Favre/Bloomberg] What does the rest of the world say about the embargo? Resoundingly: end it. For years, the United Nations General Assembly has taken a vote, and the results are overwhelming. The UNs resolution calling for an end to the embargo was adopted for the 29th time on June 23, with 184 countries in favour of ending it, three abstaining and just two voting to continue it: the US and Israel. The vote is symbolic, however, since only the US Congress can actually end the economic sanctions against Cuba. So far, the administration of US President Joe Biden -- and the USs narrowly Democratically-controlled Congress -- have not made a move to do so. A woman shouts pro-government slogans as anti-government protesters march in Havana, Cuba on July 11, 2021 [File: Ismael Francisco/AP Photo] What have the protests achieved so far? The Cuban government announced it would ease customs restrictions on food, medicine and hygiene products brought into the country by travellers, but its unclear how much of a difference that will make since tourism remains down as the pandemic continues. More broadly, the protests have served to draw attention to Cubans plight and spotlighted long-standing issues that need to be addressed with new urgency.",
Cuba Protesters at White House: Joe Biden 'Has the Power to Stop This in One Day',https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/16/cuba-protesters-white-house-joe-biden-power-stop-this-one-day/,07/16/21,www.breitbart.com,"A group of protesters urging American action to protect the lives of thousands of Cubans who began protesting peacefully against the regime this week across the island told Breitbart News on Thursday that the communist regime has launched a ""civil war"" and ""genocide"" against those seeking freedom. While Cuba has seen a growing number of peaceful assemblies against the ruling Castro regime in the past decade, the scale of the protests that began on Sunday - spanning over 60 municipalities from one tip of the island to the other - is a dramatic escalation from what the country has experienced in recent memory. The scale of the repression on the part of the regime has also grown. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead of the ruling Castro dynasty, issued an ""order of combat"" on Sunday demanding that civilian ""revolutionaries"" take the streets and violently assault anyone suspected of protesting against the regime. The regime shut down most access to the internet, but videos smuggled out of the country later this week show buses full of armed civilians driving into some of the cities with the largest presence of dissidents, apparently on orders to attack protesters. Members of the Cuban exile community organized a protest in front of the White House on Thursday both to demand that President Joe Biden act to save lives in the country and to raise awareness for the scope of the violence their brethren in the country are facing at the hands of their state. The protesters were adamant that reports in left-wing establishment media outlets attributing the protests to a rise in Chinese coronavirus cases were deliberately obscuring the true demands of those taking the streets. ""They are not asking for food - that they need it - they are not asking for medicine - that they need it, too - they are not even asking for medical attention, that they need it. They are asking for freedom,"" one woman at the event told Breitbart News. ""People in Cuba are tired of being repressed by the regime, the government. Its 62 years of repression, people going to jail just for saying 'freedom of speech,'"" another protester said. ""In Cuba there is no freedom of speech. ... They dont need food - well, they need it, but theyre not fighting for that."" Both protesters emphasized the many reports that the Castro regime is forcing civilians, including minors, to violently assault fellow citizens - and the fact that protesters cannot defend themselves because Cubans do not have the right to bear arms under the Communist Party. The attacks, the female protester said, are ""against people without any weapons because we have no weapons over there - its not like here where you can go and buy a gun or whatever you want."" ""Over there, theres no weapons. And these people are shooting our people, our mothers, our brothers, our children. Theyre killing kids,"" she lamented. The man accompanying her at the protest noted reports that the regime is sending police ""inside peoples homes and taking kids, underaged, and mak[ing] them go fight against their own people."" The protester demanded not military intervention by the Untied States, but a decree by President Biden that would allow Cubans in the United States to travel to the island and defend the protesters. ""Were going to do it. If you dont want to do it, no military intervention, were going to do it,"" he asserted. ""He [Biden] has the power to stop this in one day,"" the female protester said. ""We are asking for humanitarian intervention. If he doesnt want to do it or cant do it, at least let us go inside and help our people over there."" A third protester noted unconfirmed reports that some of the uniformed officers attacking protesters appeared to clearly possess accents that were not Cuban, potentially indicating the importing of Venezuelan troops to repress Cuban people. Late dictator Hugo Chavez and successor Nicolas Maduro orchestrated the colonization of the oil-rich country under the Castro regime; as of 2017, reports indicated that nearly 100,000 Cuban government agents were in Venezuela helping repress protesters and run the socialist regime. Maduro offered the Cuban regime ""all the support"" possible in public remarks on Monday. ""We are here because we know America doesnt really know what is going on with our people,"" one of the protesters explained. ""America needs to know that 90 miles from the United States, there is a genocide ... this administration has the power to stop a genocide right now and they are not doing nothing [sic], just talking and talking."" ""Theyre pulling the teenagers and bringing them to the street to fight people that are still on the street,"" she explained. ""Its not two or three against them - its like maybe ten people inside your house getting your husband and killing him in front of your children ... this is a genocide."" The protesters repeatedly referenced a video surfacing from Cardenas, northwestern Cuba, this week of a home invasion by Cuban ""black berets,"" or police special forces. The video appears to show an officer break into the home with an attack dog and shoot a man in his living room, in front of his wife - who can be heard screaming in the video - and their twin two-year-old sons. Reporters later identified the man as Daniel Cardenas Diaz. His wife, Marbely Vasquez, told Miamis El Nuevo Herald that her husband marched peacefully on Sunday, which apparently prompted a mob of plain-clothed police and armed civilians to beat him in his own home, causing most of the large pool of blood seen in the video. The officer then came in and shot him, taking him away to a police station. Cardenas health status is unknown at press time.",

The desperation is so great; the shortages, the obstacles and the penalties are so many. Plus, the quarantines, hunger, and no medicines is so hard to live with; that they had to lose their fear and go out to protest. It started in San Antonio de los Banos on the outskirts of Havana and spread all over Cuba. It took me a while to believe it. Could they be running to catch some sort of transport? They asked over the phone from one Cuban to another. But little by little it became credible because it was gigantic. A special program on the official television with the despicable Humberto Lopez ended up in convincing those manipulated by official propaganda and without internet. They believe the story that on social networks everything is fake news. So, just like everywhere else, people from Mayari started to organize going out on the streets using a local Facebook Buy and Sell page. Some were enthusiastic to go, according to the comments, the same happened in the larger city of Holguin and other municipalities. Some young people and business owners arrived shouting 'Patria y Vida (Homeland and Life), and 'It has already started, go out to the street. In the Cocal neighbourhood a group was getting ready to march through the towns main street to the center. A business owner named Julio Antonio Lopez Rodriguez (alias Koqui), set out on his moped with another person behind and moved through the main streets of the city encouraging people to come out shouting 'Patria y Vida. Then torrential rain started and lasted several hours until nightfall of this now historic July 11th, and the momentum was lost. By the time the rain stopped the streets had been taken over by a Ministry of Interior (MININT) presence. Likewise, the army activated command posts of military defense and they began to recruit the reserves. The word on the street is that the country is in 'phase 1 activating and mobilizing the Defence Councils. To prevent the spread of a national protest among people and looting of shops and warehouses, they mobilized all the administrators of state retail businesses and food service units, along with political agents and community officials to protect these state properties. The main potential targets that were highly militarized were the shops that sell in US dollars. For months they have been the object of popular rejection because they sell only in a foreign currency. They were the target of assaults by angry crowds in various parts of the country. Since Sunday, police cars and motorbikes with officers patrol the streets of the city constantly, as if there was no shortage of petrol. Internet was suspended here since Sunday night and it became more dangerous to walk in groups. ""The objective is that people remain disconnected and hearing only the official message,"" said Confesor Verdecia, a local human rights activist. ""The strategy is always the same, highlight the protests as an act of mercenaries instigated by the 'empire (EUA) and not a legitimate popular reaction"". ""I have contacts with thousands of people in the opposition inside and outside of Cuba, and no one told me of any special organization for yesterday, Sunday. It was the same as usual on the social networks, but there was no sign of anything coordinated. This was something spontaneous and the truth is, that is the only way things work in Cuba. Anything organized fails because the State Security neutralizes it immediately. ""I went to the street like others to show up and join in, but very quickly the rain started and the internet didnt work. Even though there was no protest here what happened Sunday was incredible. I still find it hard to believe that people have been that courageous. This country is waking up and now I believe that yes, we can have hope that this is going to change and that one day we will have democracy and freedom. I am hopeful, if this continues we have to be part of it"". The lack of communication makes it impossible to know all of the incidents and the details. In this municipality in the Guaro area, a small town ten kms from the main municipality, an opponent Teresa Miranda Cespedes began banging saucepans at 9 oclock at night in support of the protests all over the country and this was counteracted by a hate rally on the part of local official agents. ""Everything seems to indicate that they were ready for whatever I would do, they stopped me. Vulgar and offensive people, the same as the neighbourhood defence committee (CDR). One of the women wanted to attack me and I had to defend myself with stones to make her back off,"" Miranda Cespedes told Diario de Cuba. On Monday morning, July 12th, Koqui, the business owner who did the rounds of the city encouraging people to come out on the street shouting 'Patria y Vida, was detained in a dramatic operation by MININT and is still imprisoned and in isolation. Neighbours and family members confirmed that if he is not released quickly, they will go back out on the streets to demand his freedom. Read more from Osmel Ramirez here on Havana Times.",
"Cubans Turn to Homemade Radio After Web Blocked, Govt Jams Signals",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/07/16/cubans-used-homemade-radios-to-avoid-the-internet-shutdown-now-they-are-being-jammed-too/,07/16/21,www.breitbart.com,"Communist Cuba has engaged in a massive campaign of radio jamming this week in response to protesting Cuban citizens taking to the airwaves - often with homemade radios - to get news in and out of the country after the regime turned off the internet. Cubas state-run telecommunications firm severely constricted the access of ordinary citizens to swathes of the internet in recent days, with social media and messaging apps all impacted. As Breitbart News reported this week, the anti-information move comes amid a rising tide of anti-government protests on the island, which are being violently repressed by the regime. Resourceful Cubans were able to sidestep the governments attempt to crack down on the flow of information on and off the island, however, by using Cubas proximity to Florida and the availability of hobbyist amateur radio operators to keep talking. Relatively simple, low-power, homemade radios allow voice communication on common civilian frequencies between Cuba and the Southern United States now, as it did decades ago in the pre-internet age. The Cuban government soon got wise to this, however, and rapidly started using extremely high-power jamming equipment to render the useful parts of the radio spectrum unusable. At the time of publication, that jamming was still ongoing, Floridian radio amateurs said. ""Dont believe the good things they say about communism. Its not real,"" said Adrian Arteaga, who escaped Cuba when he was 18. https://t.co/wdyWMlyxfX -- Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 15, 2021 Cuban exile and licensed U.S. amateur radio station operator Alex Valladares spoke to Breitbart London from Florida and explained how, after the internet went down in Cuba, he felt he had a duty to let Cubans know they werent alone and to help convey information in and out of the country. Valladares said: ""if they are protesting in Cuba and Im a free man, I think the best thing that I could do is pass them the welfare information, the emergency communication. They dont have the internet now, the government dont want them to know the truth, they dont want them to know they are organised, that they are all out on the streets."" He said he started talking to Cubans on shortwave on the frequencies he knew most Cubans would be able to receive and transmit on, with the rudimentary equipment they had. But he soon found the frequency he was using became completely flooded with high-power noise, so Valladares switched to a new one, and the same soon followed. In fact, he said, wherever Cubans were trying to talk to exiles in Florida on amateur radio, massive jamming knocking stations off the air quickly followed. ""[The interference] is following me and following the Cuban people when they have their daily nets. They dont want the people to communicate in Cuba, thats why they cut off the internet and all sorts of media is blocked ... They tried to block any signal there because they dont want the Cuban people - many who have homemade radios - they dont want them to listen to the exiles in Miami like me, and many others around Florida delivering the world to them,"" Valladares said. This was possible, he said, because the Cuban government has a large amount of decades-old jamming equipment dating back to the Cold War, when the regime would try to block broadcasts of U.S. government anti-Communist stations like Radio Marti from reaching Cuban ears. Valladares is now concerned for the wellbeing of radio operators on the island, given the degree to which speaking to the outside world is an act of defiance to a murderous regime. While he encourages his listeners not to reply vocally to his messages and to make non-verbal sounds instead to let him know they are out there while avoiding identification, it remains the case private radio operation in Cuba requires a government license, meaning the regime has a list of radio owners and their addresses. ""I always look for the best empty frequency, and I talk at 1.2kw, I know they are listening to me because I have had feedback from Cuba and they say they are listening to me,"" Valladares explained. ""There are a couple of Cubans I talked to on Sunday and Monday, but I couldnt talk to them yesterday and Im a little bit concerned about their lives, maybe the government went for them, you know?"" ""They are going after these protesters, they are looking at the [viral protest] videos and they are going after them, to their houses, they take them out at night, and they kill them. With no justification,"" he added. As Breitbart has reported this week, the Communist regime has indeed been absolutely brutal in its repression of protests, including firing into crowds, public beatings, and visiting suspected protesters at their homes and shooting them in front of their families. As for what comes next, Valladares said he would keep broadcasting and trying to find a way around the jamming. He said that, while he recognized many Americans would normally be rightly against the government getting involved in a foreign civil war, such a thing generally involves two armed sides fighting, which he said wasnt representative of the situation in Cuba. With the population totally disarmed, the protests were characterized by citizens with stones against soldiers with guns, he said, and the Cuban people needed help. He called for aid from the United States and NATO, saying: ""The government of Cuba is massacring the people who do not have weapons. Nobody in Cuba has weapons. Fidel Castro took the weapons in 1961. Anyone with a weapon has been put in jail."" ""In Cuba, the only people who have weapons are the government and they are massacring the people, and that has to be stopped ... SOS Cuba, Freedom to Cuba. The Cuban people need freedom,"" Valladares told Breitbart News. Breitbart approached the Federal Communications Commission, Radio Marti, and the American Radio Relay League for comment on the massive interference on the 40-meter band presently being experienced in the vicinity of Cuba but they all had failed, at the time of publication, to respond. Thousands of Cubans in at least 16 cities took the streets peacefully on Sunday to demand an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. https://t.co/ZX9C1gOj9v -- Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 12, 2021",

The proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of social protests around the world in recent years, including in Chile, Bolivia, the United States and France. Thousands took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilized. Early reports of protests on Sunday were also followed swiftly by internet outages and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. Service was slowly returning to normal by Friday. SOCIAL MEDIA - TOOL OR BURDEN?

JOEY JONES: At least weve moved on from 'they are protesting and risking their lives because they dont have enough vaccines-- which I think was the Administration's narrative last week. I think the problem here is that it has become the trend on the Left, especially for those in the Squad and those who have really carved out their spot in fundraising and politics by just always pointing the finger back to the U.S. We are evil because we are prosperous. That's essentially their message. We didnt bring Castro into power. We actually backed the regime or the people in power that he overthrew. So, you cant really blame us for the Castro regime coming into power. So, how do you blame us for the things they've done since they've been there like mass executions, inviting nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union into our backyard? I think an embargo is pretty reasonable response to that and I dont know why we would term limit it as long as the same people are somewhat in charge there. WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE:",

REUTERS/Kevin Fogarty July 16 (Reuters) - ""Cuba Libre"" was painted in giant block letters on the street directly in front of the Cuban embassy in Washington on Friday following unprecedented protests on the Communist-led island last weekend. The phrase - which literally means 'free Cuba' - has long been associated with both Cuban independence from Spain and later its 1959 revolution. It was not immediately clear who was behind the giant lettering, whose format echoed the yellow 'Black Lives Matter' mural that was painted on a street near the White House in 2020 during U.S. protests against racism and police brutality.

The Internet Blackout that Followed Protests in Cuba,https://havanatimes.org/features/the-internet-blackout-that-followed-protests-in-cuba/,07/16/21,havanatimes.org,"Photo: Ernesto Verdecia By Jorge Carlos de la Paz (El Toque) HAVANA TIMES - When the massive protests broke out on Sunday, July 11, the Government decided without warning to restrict access to social media and other internet services. Reports began to come in from Cubans about the missing services. Additionally, the restrictions were confirmed by a report from the internet monitor, NetBlocks. After more than 48 hours without internet, various Cubans on the island reported a gradual reestablishment of access to the network. Data from Internet NetBlocks confirmed the partial interruption of social media and messaging networks from July 12th. WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and some servers of Telegram were blocked by the Cuban Telecommunications Company (Etecsa). ""The NetBlocks internet performance metrics at 50 points of observation from July 12th, 2021 confirmed that the front end and back end servers of the listed online platforms have stopped being partially or totally available to landlines and cell phones in Cuba, which corroborates reports from users,"" the company reported. During this lapse, Cubans were unable to communicate using these networks both inside and outside the country. Likewise, online consumer services were blocked and, of course, access to groups buying and selling food, medicine, and other products in messaging and other social media platforms. Sunday, July 11, thousands of people came into the streets across the country in an unprecedented demonstration inside Cuba. They demanded freedom, change, vaccination, and, generally, solutions to the current crisis in the nation. The government reacted with a confrontational attitude arguing that the demonstrations were only ""acts of public disorder and vandalism"" encouraged from outside the country. After convoking ""the revolutionaries"" to take over the streets and confront the protestors,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel declared ""the people"" were reacting spontaneously. ""defending their reasons and their truths, and we have many comrades who have been injured, many of these people were beaten and stoned by all these delinquents."" There are reports and evidence of known groups of para-police dressed as civilians passing for ""the people"" acting under the passive gaze of the uniformed forces of order with whom they collaborate. The Cuban government pointed to external enemies as the only cause of what it called ""disturbances"" and blamed social media for having incited Sundays actions. Tuesday, July 13, the Minister of Foreign Relations, Bruno Rodriguez, was asked twice at a press conference by foreign journalists about the restriction of data in Cuba. ""In the face of attacks, of course we will respond with measures in an appropriate manner and always based on consensus,"" he said, alluding to difficulties in the network and computer nodes as being cause by ""the difficult economic situation."" Rodriguez mentioned that ""the nation is living through a complex situation,"" and he recognized that access to information is a right; however, the diplomat avoided confirming that the cut was deliberate, nor did he explain why it happened, directing his comments to problems in the distribution of food and electricity. Shortly thereafter, journalist Arleen Rodriguez admitted on the Roundtable program that ""the cut"" to service had been deliberate. ""I understand, as a journalist, although it hurts me, the cut in social media because its where the war against Cuba is being carried out,"" she said, referring to another topic. Cuban citizens have expressed anger over this restriction that has kept them without communication in the middle of uncertainty. Whats more, we are talking about one of the highest-priced services in the country (1gb for 100 CUP ($4 USD) is the most economical option). In response to a complaint from a Facebook user, the Matanzas provincial government justified the limitation of access to a ""saturation in the lines"" and promised that they would transmit the complaint to the Etecsa authorities.

(AP Photo / Ismael Francisco) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban officials rallied tens of thousands of supporters in the streets on Saturday -- nearly a week after they were stunned by the most widespread protests in decades. President Miguel Diaz-Canel-- accompanied by 90-year-old former President Raul Castro -- appeared on the seafront Malecon boulevard that had seen some of the largest protests against shortages and the political system the previous weekend. He made an impassioned speech blaming unrest on the U.S. and its economic embargo, ""the blockade, aggression and terror,"" as a crowd waved Cuban flags and those of the July 26 Movement that Fidel Castro led during Cubas revolution. ""The enemy has returned to throw all it has at destroying the sacred unity and tranquility of the citizens,"" he said. ADVERTISEMENT He ended without the traditional cry of ""Homeland or Death!"" -- a slogan mocked last week by protesters shouting, ""Homeland and life!"" Havana has been returning to normal in recent days, even if mobile internet data service - which authorities cut on Sunday - remained limited. ""There is political and social erosion ... There is a lot of disgust, we must talk more, do more things and things that were done wrong should be rectified,"" said Abel Alba, a 50-year-old civil engineer, speaking Friday. ""The president has tried to smooth things over a bit"" but he waited ""too long"" to listen to the demands of the people in the streets. The protests began Sunday when thousands of Cubans marched along the Malecon and elsewhere to protest food and medicine shortages, power outages and some even calling for political change. Smaller protests continued MOnday and Tuesday. Diaz-Canel initially responded by pointing to U.S. economic sanctions, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a social media campaign by Cuban American groups. But he later acknowledged some responsibility by Cubas leaders. With this in mind, Cuban Cabinet ministers announced a mix of measures including permits for travelers to import food and medicine without limits and allowing people to use their ration books to obtain subsidized goods outside their hometowns. ""The Cuban government has just shown that it could have allowed the entry of food and medicine without quantity limits or tariffs all along but chose not to do so for more than a year of the pandemic,"" wrote Jose Jasan Nieves, director of the independent digital newspaper, El Toque. ""People twisted their arms."" ADVERTISEMENT Authorities reiterated their intentions to finish authorizing small and medium-sized companies as a source of employment as well as a program for state companies to pay more than the current salary scale. What officials also made clear is that they are not willing to make changes to the islands political model. Street vendor Marlen Rodriguez, 66, was not optimistic following the governments announcements. ""There are no medicines, there is nothing, there is no food."" According to Diaz-Canel, there were four sectors involved in the protests: radical supporters of the United States who waved that countrys flag during the protests and demanded intervention from Washington, criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot, people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives and young people who feel disenfranchised. The marches turned violent with police clashing with protesters, patrol cars being destroyed, shops looted, windows broken, stones thrown and violent arrests and injuries. ""When people with weak minds let themselves be influenced, these things like what happened on Sunday occur,"" said Tal(ia Linares, a 19-year-old student who turned out for Saturdays rally. ""So we are here to show that that isnt Cuban youth."" One government opponent died in the protests and the exact number of people arrested is not known. Government opponents have said on social media that the number is more than 100. On Friday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, called for release of the protesters. The measures announced by the government ""are positive measures, but they are insufficient,"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny Perez. ""Without affecting the ideology, there is a lot of space in which the state can take action,"" he said, mentioning permits for private entrepreneurs to import goods without going through the state monopoly, allowing foreign companies to install retail markets or raising the ceiling for agricultural prices in order to increase supply. But political analysts said the economic challenges are great. ""I think the government is just trying to signal to people that it understands their desperation and that its going to try to alleviate some of the misery that theyre experiencing. The problem is that the government just doesnt have much in the way of resources that it can devote to doing that,"" said William LeoGrande, an expert on Cuba at the American University in the United States. LeoGrande said the unrest in Cuba and the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise have put the Caribbean back on the agenda of U.S. President Joe Biden. ""There is no question that the demonstrations in Cuba and the assassination of Haitis president and the resulting unrest there have pushed the Caribbean to the top of President Bidens foreign policy agenda, even though they would have preferred that it stayed on the back burner for a much longer time,"" he said. ""What the administration will do on Cuba is still very much up in the air.""",

Miami Embraces Cuba Protests: 'I Never Thought That This Day Would Come',https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/us/cuba-protests-miami-florida.html,07/17/21,www.nytimes.com,"MIAMI -- The moment that Cuban exiles in Florida have so fervently ached for over the past six decades did not come when the Soviet Union fell in 1991 or when Fidel Castro died in 2016. It arrived, to their surprise, last Sunday, when Cubans on the island rushed the streets to denounce a Communist government that has left them oppressed, sick and hungry. Finally, exiles thought, the Cuban people were taking matters into their own hands. The uprising, led by artists and other young activists on the island, inspired thousands of their relatives, friends and former countrymen to protest in solidarity in Miami, Tampa and other cities in Florida, where three generations of exiles and their progeny have dreamed of a free Cuba. Even as the protests in Cuba have appeared to quiet down following the arrests of many protesters, the gatherings in Florida, including large ones in Miami, continued throughout the week. The flash of unrest re-energized exiles hopes for an end to the Communist regime, a cause that had, to some extent, languished after so many years of dashed hopes. ""I never thought that this day would come,"" Melisa Luis, a 19-year-old college student who arrived in the United States from Cuba four years ago, said at a small protest outside of Miami City Hall on Thursday.",

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity. A march was held Saturday in Hialeah for human rights in Cuba. Thats what those involved called the amazing show of unity. Local 10's Hatzel Vela joined the hundreds in Hialeah marching along West 16th Avenue for more than ten blocks on Saturday morning. Along the march, the crowd sang songs that have become synonymous to the Cuban struggle. It marked the seventh consecutive day of protests since the unprecedented uprising in Havana last weekend. Almost a week later and the love of patria, of country, remains vibrant in all generations. ""In 1980 my grandfather came here on the Mariel boat lift in search for freedom,"" said protestor Yazmin Gonzalez. ""His bravery is what led me to be here today."" The crowd started to gather at the corner of West 16 Avenue and 49th Street. Ad Homeland and life has become the anthem here and on the island. Like many here in South Florida, 25-year-old Yvelisse Suarez, who lives in Kendall, is concerned about her relatives back in Holguin. As days of protests are ongoing in many parts of the island nation of Cuba, people in South Florida are taking to the streets in solidarity. ""Im here for my parents, for my grandparents, for every family member that I have left there,"" said protestor Yvelisse Suarez. ""They dont have food. They dont have medicine and they dont have anything."" Daniel Rodriguez told Local 10 News his spoke to his mother in Cienfuegos Saturday morning, and that she tells him repression is high and Cubans are fearful. ""If you even like a comment against the dictatorship, they can come to your house and drag you out to the jail,"" he said. In Havanas Malecon, thousands took part in a staged pro-government protest. Many were bused in, and for the first time since the widespread protests, former leader Raul Castro was seen. On Friday, the Cuban community marched through Little Havana, calling for freedom on the communist island. Ad The group of nearly 150 people marched more than two miles, from Cafe Versailles toward Domino Park. Eduardo Moya with Lifestyle Miami, along with other organizers, planned Fridays protest. The hope is that the gatherings seen all week long will prompt change in Cuba that will ultimately free its people. ""We want to show them that the fight is on this side as well too, its not just them over there,"" said Moya. ""And continue to support them in any way we can."" The protests will continue during the weekend, with several scheduled for Saturday; one is planned at the Freedom Tower in Downtown Miami at 5:30 p.m. in which people like Willy Chirino and Emilio Stefan, among others, are expected to be there and speak at a press conference, scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Another protest is happening by boat in Biscayne Bay Saturday at 5:30 p.m. as well.",
"Cuba resorting to citizen spies, plainclothes cops to crush dissent",https://nypost.com/2021/07/17/cuba-resorting-to-citizen-spies-internet-limits-to-crush-dissent/,07/17/21,nypost.com,"After stemming historic protests across Cuba by shutting down digital communications this week, the islands beleaguered Communist government is now beefing up a more traditional way of stifling opposition -- citizen spies. The rapid-response brigades, which are made up of civilian snitches -- neighbors, co-workers and plainclothes cops loyal to the regime -- are out in force after protesters demanding food, medicine and freedom took to the streets beginning July 11, according to dissident bloggers on the island. Cuban journalist Yoani Sanchez reported an increase in the activity of the brigades, and ""a heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large cities across the country on her ""Ventana 14"" podcast Friday. ""The government lost the street and are using anything they can to stop the protests,"" said Ted Henken, a Baruch College sociology professor and expert on Cuba. Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez reported a ""heavy police presence"" on the streets of many large Cuban cities. Bloomberg via Getty Images The brigades are vigilante organizations first deployed to spy on citizens in the 1990s, at the beginning of the so-called Special Period, when the Soviet Union withdrew its economic support ushering in rationing of food and medicine and leading to a major popular revolt in 1994. ""They never stopped functioning,"" said Andy Gomez, the retired dean of International Studies at the University of Miami. The brigades are often combined with undercover cops, under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees domestic security and intelligence gathering, he said. Information collected from the brigades are used to target government opponents, many of whom are arrested and tortured, often held for years without due process, Gomez said. A woman shouts during an anti-government protest in Havana, Cuba on July 11, 2021. Ismael Francisco/AP There are thousands of brigade members throughout the island, according to Gomez. Many are fiercely loyal to the regime, while others are forced to sign up to snitch if they want to keep their government jobs. The spies linked to MININT, as the Ministry of the Interior is known, are universally feared on the island, much more so than the Cuban military, which has never been deployed against Cubans, Gomez told The Post. ""Cuba has never called on the armed forces to put down any social unrest because they consider themselves an army of the Cuban people,"" Gomez said. Since the start of the protests, more than 200 people have been detained, according to human rights groups. Authorities have also raided the homes of dozens of demonstrators who they have identified from videos of the protests, Henken told The Post.

Garcia, who wrote about his brief detention in a Facebook post Thursday, described how he shared a cell with several other protestors who ""were all Cubans, fighting for a free and prosperous Cuba ... a Cuba without dictators."" When protests first spread across Cuba this week, ETECSA, the state telecommunications company, shut down the Internet, accusing the US of funding a cyber-campaign to foment rebellion on the island. ""These days, the US doesnt need missiles or Marines,"" said Bruno Rodriguez, the Cuban foreign minister. ""They have bots and automated cyber accounts."" While the Castro dynasty that ran Cuba since the 1959 revolution officially ended when Fidel Castros 90-year-old brother Raul stepped down as leader of the Communist party in April, he is still very much in control, even though Miguel Diaz-Canel is president of the country. ""Its still Castroism without the Castros in charge,"" said Henken. Raul Castro made a rare public appearance alongside Diaz-Canel Saturday as Diaz-Canel blamed the uprising on the decades-long US embargo against the island. On Friday he slammed President Biden for calling Cuba ""a failed state."" ""A failed state is that which, to please a reactionary and blackmailing minority, is capable of doing damage to 11 million humans,"" Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. ""If President Joseph Biden was really worried about the humanitarian issues facing the Cuban people, he would eliminate the 243 measures imposed by President Trump, including the more than 50 cruelly imposed during the pandemic."" The advent of the mobile internet in Cuba, which came in December 2018, is the main reason behind the build-up of protests on the island, according to Henken, an editor of the recently published book, ""Cubas Digital Revolution: Citizen Innovation and State Policy. ""Everyone involved in any protest or march could suddenly document in real time using Twitter and Facebook Live, and no longer needed to be tied to a computer or hotspot,"" he said. ""Its a big blow to totalitarianism, which only thrives by keeping people ignorant and isolated.""",

Cubas President Miguel Diaz-Canel has denounced what he said was a false narrative over unrest on the Caribbean island, speaking alongside ex-president Raul Castro during a rally before thousands of supporters in Havana. ""What the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie,"" Diaz-Canel said on Saturday, denouncing the dissemination of ""false images"" on social networks where they ""encourage and glorify the outrage and destruction of property."" Diaz-Canels comments come six days after historic demonstrations against the government. On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities around the island shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""Were hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested, including independent journalists and opposition activists, since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. There is an ""overflowing hatred on social networks,"" the president said. Cesen la mentira, la infamia y el odio. #Cuba es profundamente alergica al odio. !Y jamas sera tierra de odio!

Protesters took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest against power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party political system. Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilised. Cuba cut off internet access on the island on Sunday and restored it on Wednesday, but access to social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter remained blocked on 3G and 4G networks. Diaz-Canel, who accuses the United States of having provoked the protests, said the ""lie"" was not committed ""by chance or mistake; all this is the cold calculation of an unconventional-war manual"". ""Born to conquer and not to be conquered!"" shouted the crowd at the rally, which had gathered at dawn on the Malecon, Havanas famed oceanfront boulevard. Castro, 90, was drawn out of retirement by the gravity of the protests. Shortly before the rally began, police arrested a man who shouted ""Patria y Vida"" (""Homeland and Life""), the title of a protest rap song that became the anthem of the anti-government demonstrators, according to AFP news agency. The official newspaper, Granma, said similar rallies were called in other cities including Santiago de Cuba, Bayamo, Camaguey and Santa Clara.",

Cuba's president slams social media 'hatred' after protests,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/17/cuba-president-slams-social-media-hatred-after-protests,07/17/21,www.aljazeera.com,"Havana, Cuba - The Cuban government held a massive rally in the early hours of Saturday morning on Havanas Malecon, the citys famed corniche, at the end of a week of unrest that spurred a slew of international criticism. Crowds for the ""Act of Revolutionary Reaffirmation"" rally in the Cuban capital, which the government said numbered 100,000, arrived before the sun rose and spilled onto the highway near the United States embassy. Other rallies were held across the country. People had travelled in by buses and trucks and were met by the music of Silvio Rodriguez, one of the few famous Cuban musicians not to criticise the governments fierce response to the protests last week. ""Im here to support the Cuban revolution,"" Yilian Llanes told Al Jazeera. ""To give my support as a representative of young Cubans, and to express my discontent with the violent protests that took place in our country."" Those protests began last Sunday in the town of San Antonio de los Banos. Residents were furious with hours-long blackouts but people quickly spilled onto streets across the island due to anger over months of food and medicine shortages. People participate in a rally in Havana [Alexandre Meneghin/Reuters] Police cars were turned over, a few hated MLC stores - where necessities can only be purchased in foreign currencies - were looted, and clashes with police and government supporters broke out. The states response - arresting hundreds, including protesters who were pulled from the crowds and detained without having their families informed of where they were - earned a rebuke from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Friday. ""All those detained for exercising their rights must be promptly released,"" Michelle Bachelet said. 'Viva Cuba Libre People began being bused to Havanas Vedado neighbourhood from local party headquarters from 4:30am (08:30 GMT) on Saturday for the rally. They carried party flags, banners and placards showing revolutionary heroes such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Raul Castro, the 90-year-old brother of Fidel who stepped down as the first secretary of the Communist Party in April, made an appearance but did not speak. Instead, the microphone was given to his successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel. ""Viva Cuba Libre,"" shouted Diaz-Canel, before launching into an attack on social media, access to which the government had restricted for much of the last week. ""Hate robs us of the time to love. We have experienced that in the last week on social media. The owners of these networks, the dictators of those algorithms, have opened their platforms to hatred, without the slightest ethical concern,"" he said. 'Viva Cuba Libre, shouted Diaz-Canel, before launching into a furious attack on social media [Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] ""It is a hatred that fractures friends, families, society and threatens to make many of our values useless."" In contrast to last weekends protests, the crowd on Saturday was older. People had been called up by their workplaces and many wore the T-shirts of state industries, such as oil distributor CUPET. Others wore pro-Cuba slogans. Still, young people participated in the rally, including 27-year-old Kenneth Fowler, who told Al Jazeera he is a professor at the University of Havana and had come with students from the chemistry faculty. ""Last weekend we had an attempt against the safety of our society,"" he said. ""It was part of a much greater attack by the US government and the capitalist system. The president called for people to come forward and defend our achievements. So thats why Im here."" On Thursday night, during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, US president Joe Biden made it clear that he would continue Donald Trumps policy of denying Cubans money by continuing to block remittances sent by relatives abroad. The UNs Bachelet also criticised the 60-year US embargo. COVID-19 infections Meanwhile, news of the rally spurred criticism from those who have been watching COVID-19 flood every corner of the island. The average daily number of new cases has risen above 6,000 and hospitals are being overwhelmed in several provinces. Amilcar Perez Riverol, a post-doctoral fellow in molecular biology at Sao Paulo State University in Brazil and a veteran of Cubas laboratories, has been a staunch supporter of Cubas health workers and scientists as they have fought the virus and developed homegrown vaccines. He tweeted that for a country that is currently fifth in the world and first in Latin America in terms of infections per capita, the decision to rally seemed disastrous. ""These rallies arent good news for the control of the current surge in Cuba. Not only because of the potential infections during the rallies but for the message they send,"" Perez Riverol told Al Jazeera on Saturday. But on the Malecon, Fowler said a show of unity was too important to worry about the further spread of the virus. ""We need to show our decision to fight together, I think that is more important,"" he said. ""And you know what? I didnt hear anyone telling that to the protesters last weekend.""",
Two asylum policies? Cubans arriving by boat turned back but those crossing southwest border face better odds,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/two-asylum-policies-cubans-boat-southwest-border-odds,07/17/21,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The Biden administration this week warned Cubans attempting to enter the U.S. by boat that they would be turned back or sent to a third country -- all while tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the southern border are being let in. ""Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week about migrants from Cuba and Haiti coming across the Florida Straits. MAYORKAS SAYS MIGRANTS FLEEING CUBA, HAITI BY SEA WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER US As political protests against the authoritarian communist regime rock the country, there are fears of a spike in migrants fleeing. Mayorkas said DHS has not yet seen a surge, but warned that those coming over would not come in -- but could be referred to a third country. ""They are returned by vessels of interdiction. If individuals establish a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, they are referred to third countries for settlement,"" he said. ""They will not enter the United States."" While Mayorkas comments do not reflect a new policy by DHS, and such policies have been carried out by different administrations for years, it is a stark contrast to the Biden administrations approach to the southern border. There, the administration has ended the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) which kept migrants in Mexico and the Asylum Cooperative Agreements (ACAs), which were agreements with Northern Triangle countries to have migrants claim asylum there instead rather than in the U.S. Additionally, while it is expelling single adults via Title 42 public health protections, it is not expelling migrant families or unaccompanied children -- and has made it a focus to quicken the process by which families and children are processed and released into the United States, often without court dates. ARIZONA AG BRNOVICH URGES BIDEN TO REVERSE REPORTED TITLE 42 REPEAL AFTER BORDER NUMBERS RISE AGAIN His remarks drew criticism of double standards from the right, and accusations of cruelty from the left. ""Why doesn't he say this to illegals crossing our southern border?"" Texas Rep. Lance Gooden tweeted. NBC News meanwhile reported how human rights activists had described the decision as ""shameful"" and ""disappointing."" Among those criticisms was the contrast between what those encountered at the land border, and those encountered at sea. MIGRANT ARRESTS AT SOUTHERN BORDER ROSE YET AGAIN IN JUNE TO 188,000, TOPPING 1M THIS FISCAL YEAR Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News that the approaches to each of the issues were inconsistent, and noted that Cuban nationals who entered via the southern border could be processed into the U.S. and would not be sent to a third country - which is completely different to what happens if they come by boat. ""So if you're Cuban and you make it to Mexico and you walk across the southern border illegally, they are not returning you to a third country,"" he said in an interview this week. ""But if you are Cuban and you try and flee by boat over the Florida Straits then they are according to the secretary, so its very inconsistent."" He argued that the policy the administration was pursuing with maritime interdictions, namely sending migrants to third countries, was similar to the Trump-era policy at the border which the Biden administration quickly unraveled. ""If they want to resettle folks claiming asylum in a third country, that's exactly what the Trump administration was doing for the southwest border, that's why we had the ACAs, its why we had MPP -- that's the whole strategy,"" he said. ""It should also be the policy, it doesn't matter how you come to the country, it should be the policy wherever were at, and that was the type of policy we were working on and getting to in the Trump administration so there would not be this rush and this crisis that you see today,"" he said. A DHS spokesperson told Fox News that there has not been a change in policy, and the policy has long been to return those interdicted at sea to their country of nationality or to a third country for resettlement. ""Individuals encountered on US soil are processed under laws governing such processing. Third country resettlement is an option for those who are interdicted at sea,"" the spokesperson said. There is also a question of the particular countries' human rights records. The communist regime in Cuba is known for its brutality against those who oppose it. Wolf said its record is one of the worst in the hemisphere, and so one may expect nationals from there to be a priority for asylum requests. ""This administration talks a lot about asylees and needing to protect individuals that are being persecuted, and I think of all the countries we see, at least in this hemisphere, except for maybe Venezuela, Cuba is probably the most oppressive government we have,"" he said. ""So the question is why are they not allowing folks from Cuba to resettle in the U.S. like they are folks from Guatemala when the asylum claim from Cuba is likely greater."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The debate comes amid increasing pressure on the White House on the issue of Cuba, as well as questions over its handling of the southern border. On Friday, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced there had been more than 188,000 migrants encounters at the border, including more than 55,000 family units. Of those family units, only just over 8,000 had been turned away via Title 42, the stats show.",

In recent days Cuban protesters have expressed anger over rising prices, shortages of goods and poor health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ""They are really being led by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and the progressive wing does not want to go hard against Cuba, against some of the things that the Castro regime may have been a part of it,"" Olorunnipa argued on CNN's ""Inside Politics"" Sunday.

Biden needs to move fast to provide satellite internet for silenced Cuban protesters,https://nypost.com/2021/07/17/biden-must-provide-satellite-internet-for-silenced-cuban-protesters/,07/18/21,nypost.com,"So far, all President Joe Biden has offered the tens of thousands of protesters risking their lives to call for freedom in Cuba are a few words of support. Its time to do more -- by acting to secure internet access on the island. Since last Sunday, Cubans have been taking to the streets across the nation to demand freedom from the dictatorship, adequate access to food and medicine and the resignation of President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The regime responded by telling police to open fire and by shutting down Web access to stop demonstrators from communicating via Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram and sharing images of his goons violence. In a letter to the White House, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla. -- and a Cuban American) outlined several steps Washington should take beyond well-wishing. The key: enabling open and free satellite Internet access. Biden said Thursday that hes considering it, telling reporters: ""Theyve cut off access to the Internet. Were considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access."" That sounds like a stall: The feds should know that already, since the ideas been suggested for years, for example when Irans rulers shut down the Web to squelch protests -- and its an obvious tool to help freedom-lovers around the globe in such situations. People protest Cubas government in Miami on July 12, 2021. AFP via Getty Images Delay is deadly. ""Time is of the essence here,"" as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) notes: ""Every day that the regime has to black out the truth is a day they can get the upper hand on this."" But it looks like the White House is slow-walking any response -- or, rather, leaving it to drawn-out interagency discussions, as Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for the State Departments bureau of Western Hemisphere affairs, told Politico, even as she called the idea ""something that were very interested in promoting and advocating for."" Sen. Lindsey Graham said last week of Bidens slowness to even speak up in solidarity with the protesters that the prez is ""like a deer in the headlights when it comes to standing up to oppression."" That seems to extend to jumping on the internet idea. Desperate, hungry and oppressed Cubans are waving American flags as a sign of freedom in the streets of Havana: The least Uncle Sam can do is make sure their voices ring around the world.",
Cuba Protesters Stage Die-In Outside White House,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/17/cuba-protesters-covered-in-blood-stage-die-in-outside-of-white-house/,07/18/21,www.breitbart.com,"Three adults and two children dressed in ""Young Pioneer"" uniforms laid in front of the White House in Washington, DC, on Saturday covered in ""blood"" and draped in Cuban flags, demanding the U.S. government help anti-communist protesters. The uniforms are those used in Cuban schools; ""Young Pioneers"" are children who excel in communist indoctrination programs at a young age and receive advanced education and benefits, recognizable by their red kerchiefs. ""Pioneer"" programs are common in all communist countries. As several hundred #SOSCuba protesters chanted ""Freedom for Cuba"" outside the gates of President Joe Bidens home on Pennsylvania Avenue, a small group of protesters performed what is called a ""die-in"" to represent Cubans slain by Cubas brutal communist regime. As they laid still on the concrete, the protesters were surrounded by signs. ""Youre sitting by while we die,"" one of the signs read. ""Cubas blood is on your hands,"" another read. Protesters came from all over the country, including groups who bused from Miami to D.C., to participate in the demonstration. Protests have sparked in the U.S. and around the world since thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Cuba last Sunday and throughout the week, calling for the end of Fidel Castros 62-year dictatorship. While Castro himself died in 2016, the Castro family continues to control the island through its domination of the military. The news of protests in Cuba spread via social media before the Cuban government shut down the islands internet. More than 40 municipalities have participated so far, making it the largest anti-government protest on the island in decades. Since protests in Cuba began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten people in the streets. Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people so far, Breitbart News reported. Current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued late Sunday. Breitbart News spoke with several protesters, many of whom came from Cuba directly or have family who did. The protesters warned of communism in the United States and spoke of atrocities in Cuba, including how young adults and teens are being forcefully taken from their homes by the government and made to fight against their own family and friends. Demonstrators in D.C. cloaked themselves in Cuban and American flags and called on the Biden Administration to intervene in Cuba to put an end to the grave human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Cuban government. Many protesters held signs on Saturday condemning Biden for his inaction so far. ""Biden, history will remember how you turn your back to Cuba & all the Cubans who voted for you,"" one sign read. Other signs insisted Biden take military action rather than engage in talks with a murderous regime. ""Joe Biden, we need military intervention in Cuba, not dialogue or business with the fucking government,"" another sign read. Protesters around the U.S. who have joined the Cuban people from afar, as well as some politicians, have ""escalated their calls for military intervention against the Castro regime to defend the lives of unarmed, peaceful Cuban protesters,"" Breitbart News reported. A petition at Change.org urging military intervention has attracted nearly 400,000 signatures as of Wednesday, suggesting the idea is more popular than many establishment media outlets in the United States have suggested. Bidens response to protests in Cuba has been criticized for being unenthusiastic and slow. On Wednesdays broadcast of the Fox News Channels Fox & Friends, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wished the Biden administration denounced the tyranny of Cuba with ""half the passion"" that they have for denouncing Republican elected officials. During a press conference on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is reviewing its policies toward Cuba. ""And as we look at those policies, one of the big factors is ensuring we are not doing anything to pad the pockets of a corrupt authoritarian regime,"" Psaki said, while also suggesting Biden is considering providing humanitarian aid. President Joe Biden said Thursday the United States was considering ways to force open Internet access in Cuba, which he called a ""failed state."" He also said he would give Cuba Chinese coronavirus vaccines if he knew the shots would make it to the Cuban people. Notably, the Biden Administration did not explicitly condemn communism until several days after protests began. Psaki also asserted that Cuban protesters yelling ""freedom!"" during anti-communist protests were actually demanding ""freedom from rising COVID cases."" Biden issued an initial statement on Monday claiming to ""stand with the Cuban people,"" but he failed to mention widespread reports of public gang beatings and live fire against unarmed protesters on the part of state security.",

Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz Canel waves a Cuban national flag as he delivers a speech during a rally in Havana, Cuba on July 17, 2021. (Reuters) Cuba's President Miguel Diaz Canel has denounced what he said was a false narrative over unrest on the Caribbean island, as the Communist regime vigorously pushed back against suggestions of historically widespread discontent. ""What the world is seeing of Cuba is a lie,"" Diaz Canel said, speaking during a rally alongside ex-president Raul Castro and before thousands of supporters who had gathered on the Malecon, Havana's famed oceanfront boulevard. Government supporters gathered on the city's seafront boulevard before dawn to wave Cuban flags and photos of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. The latter retired as Communist Party leader in April but promised to continue fighting for the revolution as a ""foot soldier"". The rally, and similar ones in other cities, constituted the regime's first public response to the anti-government protests that unexpectedly brought thousands to Cuban streets last weekend. Organizers described the event on Saturday as one of ""revolutionary reaffirmation."" READ MORE: Whats spurring anti-government protests in Cuba? 'Down with the Yankees!' Cries from the crowd - ""Down with the Yankees!"" and ""We were born to conquer, not be conquered!"" - echoed the anti-imperialist language of the original Cuban revolutionary, former president Fidel Castro. Diaz-Canel decried what he said was the dissemination of ""false images"" on social networks that ""glorify the outrage and destruction of property."" Those images, he said, had caused ""immeasurable damage to the national soul."" On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""We're hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. There is an ""overflowing hatred on social networks,"" the president insisted on Saturday. His supporters, summoned from work places and universities, waved red-blue-and-white Cuban flags and the banner of the 1959 revolution. They enthusiastically applauded both Diaz Canel and Raul Castro. The presence of the 90-year-old Castro, drawn out of retirement because of the gravity of the situation, was noteworthy. He wore his olive-green general's uniform, harkening back to his revolutionary role alongside brother Fidel. ""Everyone who feels something for the revolution, who felt something for Fidel, for all he did for this country and that we must continue to do, knows what Raul's presence here means,"" said one rally participant, 65-year-old Carlos Cruz. Diaz-Canel said the ""lie"" about widespread protests was not committed ""by chance or mistake; all this is the cold calculation of an unconventional-war manual."" READ MORE: One dead as crackdown against Cuban protesters continues Protests amid economic crisis After last weekend's protests, Cuba cut off internet access on the island for three days. Even after access was restored, social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter remained blocked on 3G and 4G networks. Social media is the only way Cubans can reach independent news outlets, while messaging apps are their main means of communicating among themselves. US President Joe Biden has said Washington is considering ways to ease internet restrictions, though analysts have warned it could be tricky for technological and political reasons. The rallies were the largest since the revolution and came as the country endures its worst economic crisis in 30 years, with chronic shortages of electricity, food and medicine amid a spike in coronavirus infections. The island of 11.2 million people recorded 6,062 new cases of Covid-19, and 52 deaths, in the preceding 24 hours, the authorities said. The toll stands at 275,608 cases and 1,843 deaths. ""With or without the pandemic, we have to defend (the revolution),"" said 73-year-old teacher Hector Roman, who wore a protective mask. Havana, under US sanctions since 1962, has blamed the show of discontent on Washington pursuing a ""policy of economic suffocation to provoke social unrest."" Biden called Cuba a ""failed state"" on Thursday and said its leaders were ""repressing their citizens."" He said the US was prepared to potentially send significant amounts of Covid vaccine to the island. Cuba has also been developing its own vaccines. Shortly before the rally began, police arrested a man who shouted ""Patria y Vida"" (""Homeland and Life""), the title o f a protest rap song which has become the anthem of anti-government demonstrators. The official newspaper Granma said similar rallies were called in cities including Santiago de Cuba, Bayamo, Camaguey and Santa Clara.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis rips AOC as a 'communist sympathizer' after Cuba remarks,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nicole-malliotakis-rips-ocasio-cortez-on-cuba,07/18/21,www.foxnews.com,"Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the daughter of a Cuban immigrant, ripped her colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. on ""Fox News Live"" Sunday for partly blaming the long-held U.S. embargo for the unrest in Cuba, where protesters continue to call for an end to the communist regime. REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS: What's cruel is the way that the communist regime treats its people. There are two classes in Cuba; one is the ruling class, run by the communists, and then there is everyone else who live in squalor. They don't have access to food, they don't have access to medicine, they don't have access to the basic necessities -- and it's certainly not because of the embargo. Look, Cuba does business with nearly every country in the world, and for six decades they remained a communist regime. So Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is nothing more than a communist sympathizer who wants to bring socialism to the United States of America and I'm sure she sympathizes with the regime in Cuba. But the reality is that they use everything that they get when they do business with other countries for the regime, they use it to reward the people in the ruling class, it never gets to the people...

Cuba Protesters Warn Americans Who Like Che Guevara: 'He Was a F*cking Terrorist',https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/18/cuba-protesters-warn-americans-who-like-che-guevara-fcking-terrorist/,07/18/21,www.breitbart.com,"Protesters gathered outside of the White House on Thursday evening to urge President Joe Biden to act in support of the protests ongoing in Cuba this week told Breitbart News the mainstreaming of Castro regime mass murder Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in America undermines the suffering of those he killed. Guevara, a wealthy Irish-Argentine communist who participated in Fidel Castros seizure of the island nation in 1959, presided over the organization of firing squads to eliminate people who disagreed with Castro and pioneered the use of concentration camps in Cuba. He wrote openly that he ""really loved to kill"" and particularly enjoyed killing religious people and suspected LGBT Cubans, but his legacy in the United States has somehow morphed into that of a ""revolutionary"" representing the downtrodden. A famous portrait of the killer has become a popular t-shirt in America and the West generally. A man identifying himself as Gianni, a Cuban protester at the White House, waved a Cuban flag emblazoned with an image rejecting Guevara. He told Breitbart News that those who admire Guevara have ""the wrong information"" and urged them to become better acquainted with his true legacy. ""People think he was great and a revolutionary. What no one tells you is that he used to kill gays in Cuba. His great idea was concentration camps for gays,"" Gianni explained. ""He used to kill Christians. He used to kill people that didnt agree with him just because they wanted freedom and they didnt want to be communist."" Guevara was responsible for helping Fidel Castro implement what were known as ""Military Units to Aid Production"" (UMAP), concentration camps nominally used for agricultural labor to enrich the country - already Latin Americas wealthiest in the immediate period prior to 1959 - but in reality used to kill and repress ""undesirable"" Cubans. Anyone suspected of homosexuality, known to belong to Christian groups like the Seventh-Day Adventists or Jehovahs Witnesses, dissident writers, journalists, and others seen as a threat to communism found themselves toiling in the UMAP. Reports indicate that overwork and intentionally dangerous situations created on the ground at the UMAPs were intended to kill their inmates. ""Fuck Che Guevara, he was a fucking terrorist,"" another man attending Thursdays protest who did not identify himself told Breitbart News. ""That man killed a lot of people, you know what Im saying? He killed a lot of motherfucking people. People in the world have a wrong impression of Che Guevara ... He was in charge of killing people in Cuba."" A third protester who identified himself as Amilkal told Breitbart News of Guevara, ""He said 'we are going to kill people and we will continue to kill people if we need it. People against the revolution, were going to kill them.'"" Amilkal appeared to be referencing a famous speech Guevara delivered before the United Nations General Assembly in 1964. ""We have to say here what is a well-known truth, that we have always expressed before the world: firing squad executions, yes, we have executed,"" Guevara told the world on that occasion. ""We execute and we will keep executing so long as it is necessary. Our struggle is a struggle to the death."" ""We know what the result of a lost battle would be and the maggots [anti-communists] must also know what the result of their lost battle is today in Cuba,"" Guevara continued. The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO celebrated Guevaras birthday - and this particular speech - with a public statement last month. The protesters organized outside of the White House on Thursday did so in solidarity with Cubans on the island who took the streets in dozens of cities across the county on Sunday and, reports indicate, continue to openly protest for freedom. The protests followed months of swelling unrest against communism, largely fueled by the discontent of young Cubans who have never known any other political system. The Castro regime responded to the protests by issuing an ""order of combat"" demanding that civilians take the streets and violently attack the protesters, despite the overwhelmingly peaceful nature of the protests on Sunday. The regime also shut down the internet, making it more difficult for protesters to share videos of either protests or of the subsequent repression and making reports of ongoing manifestations difficult to confirm from abroad. The White House protesters told Breitbart News repeatedly that the Biden administration should prioritize helping restore internet access for the average Cuban person and allowing Cubans in America to return to the island and help fight the regime. ""Were going to do it. If you dont want to do it, no military intervention, were going to do it,"" one protester told Breitbart News. The protesters also expressed panic regarding reports of police engaging in door-to-door raids, shooting and possibly killing unarmed protesters in their homes, in front of their families. At least one video smuggled out of the country this week showed police opening fire on a protester in his living room, in front of his toddler children and his wife. The mans health condition remains unknown at press time. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

The Caribbean nation of 11 million people reported nearly 4,000 confirmed cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average and more than any other country in the Americas for its size.

Cuba is not alone in struggling under new waves of the pandemic. But the political implications of such a crisis are greater in a country where healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of its ""revolutionary"" one-party system. Moreover the outbreak and subsequent lockdown and reduction in numbers of flights has taxed an already bankrupt economy where many work in tourism and others rely on travelers to bring in remittances and goods including medicine. ""The government has consistently made the case that one of the main accomplishments of the revolution is its world-class medical sector,"" said Cuban American historian Daniel Rodriguez, author of a book on medical politics in post-independence Havana. Rodriguez said the exacerbation of food and medicine shortages over the past year due to the pandemic-related economic crisis had already broken Cuba's social pact. ""When the pandemic began spiraling out of control a couple of weeks ago, it appeared increasingly the revolutionary government was no longer able to protect Cuban lives, and the result was an extraordinary repudiation of the revolution itself."" 'NOT EVEN MEDICINE' Cuba's government has blamed the demonstrations on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions tightened during the pandemic. Several countries and non-government organizations including Oxfam called on Washington to lift sanctions this week. On Saturday, authorities organized pro-government rallies across the island attended by thousands. But many Cubans have aimed their anger at their own government's handling of the economy and the pandemic. ""We are hungry, there's nothing at the moment, not even medicine,"" said Aylin Sardina, 33, at a protest in Havana. Some critics complained that the authorities appeared to have ample transport to deploy security forces to quell protests and bus state workers to rallies, while lacking ambulances. To be sure, Cuba has had some pandemic successes, notably the development of five vaccine candidates, two of which have proven to have efficacy of more than 90%,according to preliminary Cuban data. read more Thanks to one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita rates in the world, it was also able to send its ""white coat army"" to help other countries, and lately to reinforce hospitals in Matanzas. Moreover cumulative cases per capita are still below the global average, while deaths per capita, though rising, are still just a third of the global average, a fact Cuba credits to its experimental treatments and its free, universal healthcare. However, with cases now rising fast, a deepening of Cuba's economic crisis has prevented officials from imposing stricter lockdowns with many Cubans having to stand in lines for hours to get scarce goods. And so far only some two million people - less than a fifth of the population - are fully vaccinated. Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol said that premature triumphal statements from state media about the Cuban vaccine candidates and rallies like Saturday's may have also led to people lowering their guard, creating a breeding ground for cases to soar. The country has an ambitious aims to have fully vaccinated 70% of the population by September. But Perez Riverol warned that in the next few weeks COVID-19 deaths would likely continue to rise as they lagged the surge in cases. ""You go out onto the street to buy food and someone says to you: do you know who else died?"" said Libia Ortega, 44, a worker in a private cafeteria in Matanzas city closed due to the pandemic and shortages of products. ""The doctors are making a big effort to save lives every day but medicine and supplies are lacking.""

"Emboldened by protests, Cuban opposition websites pique government",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/emboldened-by-protests-cuban-opposition-websites-pique-government-2021-07-19/,07/19/21,www.reuters.com,"People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini July 19 (Reuters) - Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miami's Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cuba's expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days, the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government. One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cuba's government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba. Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio. The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations. While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access. Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. read more That would mean 20% of Cuba's estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. 'IMPOSSIBLE DELUSION' In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former president Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesn't make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cuba's Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didn't realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government. A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. USAID said in a statement that it, the U.S. State Department and the National Endowment for Democracy have been funding programs ""to increase the flow of information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba"" since 1996. ""USAID has helped train hundreds of journalists over the last decade to inform Cubans on the island. Their work has also appeared in major international news outlets,"" the statement said. ADN Cuba's founder did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged. Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family. Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said. With or without U.S. funding, the sites are trying to reach readers like Jorge Norris, a 35-year-old IT engineer in Cuba, who uses a VPN to read sites such as Diario de Cuba and 14yMedio along with official Cuban media. ""It's another view to be able to form an idea of what's happening in the world,"" Norris said. ""You have to be completely informed of what they say here in Cuba and in the world.""

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - As protests calling for change in Cuba continue to occur throughout South Florida, especially in Miami-Dade County, the Cuban government has made an unprecedented announcement to allow donations to the island. The communist nation announced all plane passengers will be allowed to bring unlimited supplies of food, medicine, and hygiene products to the country between now and the end of the year. ""I actually spent the entire year of COVID there because I got stuck. So, I saw how bad it was, and its just been getting worse and worse,"" explained Vanessa Grau who is flying to Cuba with food and supplies. Grau lives in Miami, but has family on the island, including her husband. As soon as she heard about the change, she started a donation drive to collect extra food and medicine, which she brought on her flight to Havana, Monday morning. ""I just hope that it gets to go through -- I hope that what theyre saying is not a lie,"" she explained. ""I think that theyre kind of doing this to make people think, 'Oh, were good. Not really the truth, but, at least its allowing us to help some people there."" Ad The change comes more than a week after the historic uprisings in Cuba that sparked a week of solidarity protests all across South Florida. The latest protest occurred on Sunday, where nearly 100 people held a silent march through the streets of Little Havana hoping to call attention the plight of the people there on the island who are still in need of basic supplies. ""What we want to do is bring attention to the fact that people are being beaten on the streets. There are people bleeding out --women, children, youth, and that shouldnt be happening anywhere,"" explained Gabriella Gutierrez of Students for a Free Cuba. ""Just let people know that were behind them, that were going to continue fighting for freedom,"" added Grau. ""Because at the end of the day, the medicines help, but what we want at the end is freedom for all.""",
Eastern Cuba Stays in the Streets After Death of Regional Military Chief,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/19/eastern-cuba-streets-death-regional-military-chief/,07/19/21,www.breitbart.com,"Division General Agustin Pena, the commander of the Eastern Army of Cuba, died mysteriously on Saturday following rumors of Chinese coronavirus infection, leaving the military vulnerable amid nationwide protests against the ruling communist regime. Pena was 57 years old and, in addition to holding a pivotal military post, was a member of the Communist Partys central committee. The Communist Party did not disclose a cause of death or offer any indication of what preceded his passing. ""Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Sunday mourned the recent death of Division General Agustin Pena, chief of the Eastern Army, and sent his condolences to his family, friends and combatants,"" the Cuban state outlet Prensa Latina revealed on Sunday. ""On his official Twitter account, the president wrote that the news is very painful and sad."" No information suggests that Penas demise was directly related to the week-long protests throughout Cuba, which affected most of the regions Pena was in charge of the military in. Holguin, one of eastern Cubas largest cities and a command area under Pena, experienced some of the largest peaceful protests in the ongoing wave, which began on Sunday, July 11. In response to the protests, Diaz-Canel, the face of the Castro regime, ordered both the nations armed forces and civilians to violently attack anyone suspected of supporting anti-communist protests, resulting in significant violence in cities like Holguin. Some outlets have speculated that Pena died after being diagnosed with Chinese coronavirus, which has swept the nation in light of Communist Party mismanagement and the dilapidated state of its socialist healthcare system. The independent outlet 14 y Medio, whose journalists are based in Cuba, stated that multiple unnamed sources had relayed the information that Pena was at least suspected of suffering from the disease. ""Although official media have not offered information regarding Penas cause of death, Radio Rebelde journalist Aroldo Garcia Fombellida in Holguin wrote on his Facebook profile: 'he was liberated today ... against the mortal pandemic of Covid-19,'"" 14 y Medio reported. Cuba has documented 281,887 cases of Chinese coronavirus and nearly 2,000 deaths since the pandemic began, a number most experts believe is significantly lower than the true toll due to Cubas poor testing abilities and its history of fabricating medical statistics. As a member of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Cubas communist regime has close ties to its ideological allies in Beijing and has actively courted Chinese tourism. The regime also invited tourists from coronavirus hotspots like Italy at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020 while refusing to close schools or implement social distancing measures for Cuban citizens. Cubanet, another independent outlet reliant on journalists on the island, reported that widespread protests continued in at least two eastern cities, Guantanamo and Baracoa, on Saturday. Authorities arrested two Cubanet journalists last weekend for attempting to cover the first wave of protests. The Castro regime shut off access to the internet for nearly all citizens in Cuba following July 11, severely limiting the information - and images - the international media are now privy to regarding the situation on the ground in the country. Cubanet reported that ""political police,"" special forces reserved for repressing dissidents, took over Baracoa after protests began, but that the heavy law enforcement presence has not limited public displays of support for an end to the regime. Videos of protests in Baracoa, dated Saturday, July 17, surfaced on social media this weekend, showing large crowds of peaceful protesters marching in the streets. The videos appear to be taken on mobile phones by anonymous sources however, and Breitbart News could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos: Much of Cuba appears to be in a state of de facto martial law following the start of the protests, multiple Cuban interest news outlets have reported. The Spain-based Diario de Cuba newspaper reported on Sunday that San Antonio de los Banos, the city where protests are believed to have first begun last week, is flooded with ""trucks full of soldiers and the central plaza in the town has been seized by dozens of police, soldiers, and State Security agents."" The city also lacks any access to the internet, locals have denounced, with no indication of when Cubas state-run telecommunications company ETECSA will restore access. The nationwide protests resulted in an unknown number of arrests and enforced disappearances nationwide, at one point last week estimated to be as high a 5,000 people. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH) has confirmed as of Saturday 560 arrests and/or disappearances, many of them people who witnesses can confirm were taken into police custody or into hospitals after police attacks but whose family has no knowledge of their whereabouts. Many of those documented as missing or arrested are prominent members of the dissident community who already have ties to foreign groups like the OCDH; experts believe many of the arrested or disappeared could be in remote areas of the country, with no civil society infrastructure to seek to account for their wellbeing.

Could balloons power uncensored internet in Cuba?,https://nypost.com/2021/07/19/could-balloons-power-uncensored-internet-in-cuba/,07/19/21,nypost.com,"Floridas Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, called this week on the administration of President Joe Biden to greenlight a plan to transmit the internet to people in Cuba via high-altitude balloons when their government has blocked access. Can internet be delivered by balloon? Yes. For years, Alphabet -- the parent company of Google -- worked to perfect an internet-balloon division service called Loon. It shut down that project in January, saying it wasnt commercially viable. Prior to the shutdown, Loon balloons had been providing service in mountainous areas in Kenya through a partnership with a local telecom, Telkom Kenya. The service also helped provide wireless communications in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which destroyed the islands mobile network. Loon partnered with AT&T to make service available. How does that work? The Loon balloons were effectively cell towers the size of a tennis court. They floated 60,000 to 75,000 feet, or 11 to 14 miles, above the Earth, well above commercial jetliner routes. Made of the commonplace plastic polyethylene, the balloons used solar panels for electricity and could deliver service to smartphones in partnership with a local telecom. Each balloon could serve thousands of people, the company said. But they had to be replaced every five months or so because of the harsh conditions in the stratosphere. And the balloons could be difficult to control. ""Navigating balloons through the stratosphere has always been hard,"" wrote Salvatore Candido, who had been chief technology officer for Loon, in a December 2020 blog post. The company created algorithms that tracked wind patterns. What equipment was required? Loon had said that beyond the balloons themselves, it needed network integration with a telecom to provide service and some equipment on the ground in the region. It also needed permission from local regulators -- something that the Cuban government isnt likely to grant. Could a network be set up from afar? Yes. Loon used multiple balloons to extend connections beyond the necessary ground link. In one 2018 test, Loon said the connection jumped 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, over 7 balloons. Another time, it bridged a wireless connection over 600 kilometers, or about 370 miles, between two balloons. Cuba and Florida are only about 100 miles apart at their closest. Is the feasible? But experts arent sure it would be that easy to set up a guerrilla internet service for Cuba this way. It would need an unused band of spectrum, or radio frequencies, to transmit a connection to Cuba and spectrum use is typically controlled by national governments. Anyone trying this would have to find a free block of spectrum that wouldnt be interfered with, said Jacob Sharony, of Mobius Consulting, a mobile and wireless consulting firm. Balloon- or drone-powered networks arent likely to be economical over the long term, said Tim Farrar of TMF Associates, a satellite communications consultant. While theyre suitable for bridging communications amid disasters or in war zones, the transmission capabilities of such networks isnt large -- ""certainly not enough to serve the entire population of Cuba or anything like that,"" Farrar said. Another challenge: The Cuban government could also try to jam the signal. Who is involved in the Cuba effort? DeSantis promoted the balloon idea Thursday alongside two Cuban-American members of Congress from the Miami area, Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez, FCC commissioner Brendan Carr and Cuban-American lawyer, businessman and museum director Marcell Felipe. Felipe said he has been talking for about two years with a defense contractor who could deploy such balloons in a cost-effective way in airspace near Cuba, but declined to name the company. Felipe said his idea would involve transmitting internet connectivity directly to mobile phones on the island without the participation of any ground provider. In comments to The Associated Press, Felipe claimed it wouldnt be feasible for the Cuban government to block these balloon-delivered signals ""in any significant manner,'' though he didnt cite any evidence. None of the supporters provided a cost estimate. Salazar said that if the federal government endorsed the plan, she believes it could be funded entirely with contributions from members of the Cuban diaspora if necessary. What is internet access like in Cuba? Internet access in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. Starting in December 2018, Cubans could get internet access on their phones through the state telecom monopoly. More than half of Cubans today have internet access. But the Cuban government restricts independent media and censors whats available to Cubans online, according to Human Rights Watch. It disrupts internet access in an attempt to head off protests.",

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned that Russian assets are already in Cuba and have been for some time, further declaring that the heir to the Castro brothers' communist dictatorship has lost its legitimacy to govern. The Cuban communist regime, currently headed by President Miguel Diaz-Canel, has lost that legitimacy, the senator told ""Special Report"" on Monday. Earlier this month, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets across the island nation--in defiance of the ruthless regime's stranglehold on public demonstrations--to call for human rights and basic necessities. As tensions boiled over in Havana, Cuban refugees, expatriates and their families came out in a massive show of solidarity with the Cuban people in demonstrations across the Sunshine state. ""Cuba today is basically in a state of martial law and in many of the major cities across the country, troops are stationed--security forces are stationed--and the message is clear. They are also continuing to repress people,"" Rubio said, adding that in the wake of Diaz-Canel shutting down civilians' internet access, reports are still coming out of the country of torture and ""abductions"" of Cuban citizens by the government. ""This the is model [the regime in Havana has] followed a long time. The only difference between now and the past some of it is being documented and posted on social media for the world to see,"" he said. Rubio went on to warn that Cuba's ally Russia is essentially on-call for the Diaz-Canel regime, and could set up a very tenuous situation for Florida and the United States, should Kremlin resources amass just 90 miles offshore. ""Russia is already there. They have an intelligence station and so do the Chinese,"" Rubio warned. ""It's the model they follow everywhere in the world.

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - The United States is expected to soon announce initial steps as part of the Biden administrations review of Cuba policy and in response to Havana's crackdown on the biggest street protests in decades, State Department officials said on Monday. The senior officials comments further signaled that President Joe Biden was not ready to soften the U.S. approach after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era detente with Havana, and that the latest Cuban unrest would have a significant impact on any policy moves. The officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, also made clear that the Biden administration is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people while keeping pressure on the Communist-led government in Havana. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Biden said last week he was not prepared to loosen restrictions for now on remittances, or payments that Americans can make to their families on the island, because of concern that the Cuban government would seize a large part of the funds. But Washington is looking closely at crafting a possible work-around to restore the flow of remittances, which were shut down under Trump, in a way that does not put money in the hands of the Cuban government, one of the State Department officials said. The official declined to elaborate but suggested it would take time to develop such a mechanism, saying: ""I wouldn't anticipate a short-term loosening."" Thousands of Cubans staged spontaneous anti-government protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Scores of activists were detained. loading The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. 'A TOP PRIORITY' The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency in the Cuba policy review, which began shortly after Biden took office in January but until now had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad. ""There will definitely be policy implications as a result of the events over the course of the last week. ... I'd expect in fairly short order there will be a senior U.S. government communication as to initial steps,"" one official said while declining to provide specifics. Cuba, the official said, is now a ""top priority."" ""It's a historic moment in Cuba given that the protesters showed up to more than 58 locations throughout the island numbering tens of thousands, making demands of their government for change,"" the official said. Under consideration as part of the review - even before the protests occurred - is whether to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" a label Trump gave to Havana just days before leaving office. But the State Department official said there was no timeline for a decision on the issue. Also figuring into the over-arching Cuba policy review is Cubas continued support for Venezuelas Socialist president, Nicolas Maduro, whose government is also under sanction by the United States, the State Department official said. Maduro has retained power with the support not only of his military and Cuban allies but of Russia, China and Iran. Biden, a Democrat, had vowed during his presidential campaign to ease some of the sanctions on Cuba tightened by Trump, a Republican. But analysts say the protests have complicated Bidens political leeway to do so, especially after he made a poorer-than-expected showing with voters in south Floridas anti-communist Cuban-American community, which backed Trumps tough policies toward Havana and Caracas and helped him win the battleground state. Many analysts say Biden may have to tread carefully on Cuba policy ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.

The White House is hopeful that a boost in staffing could help it better facilitate civil society engagement following one of the communist islands biggest antigovernment demonstrations in recent memory. The actions were detailed by a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Biden administration hadnt yet publicly announced the effort. It comes a little more than a week after thousands of Cubans took to the streets of Havana and other cities across the island to protest food shortages and high prices during the coronavirus crisis. Its a level of frustration not seen in Cuba in more than 60 years. ADVERTISEMENT Biden is also calling for the administration to work with Congress to identify options to make the internet more accessible on the island. The regime moved to quickly cut off internet access to stop images of the protests from being broadcast to the world. Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have been urging Biden to make free satellite internet access available to dissidents to help them subvert the Cuban governments effort to stop activists from getting their messages on social media. The administration will also look to work with international organizations to increase humanitarian assistance, while the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control will explore sanctioning Cuban officials who committed human rights violations against peaceful protesters in Cuba, the official said. Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond and Juan Gonzalez, a senior National Security Council official, met on Monday with Cuban American leaders to hear their policy recommendations and concerns in the aftermath of the demonstrations, according to the White House. Biden, who has been under congressional pressure to take action, last week called Cuba a ""failed state"" that was ""repressing their citizens."" But Biden also suggested that taking effective action was complicated. ""There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government,"" Biden said. ""For example, the ability to send remittances back to Cuba. We would not do that now because the fact is its highly likely the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it."" A dramatic drawdown of embassy personnel from Cuba began in 2017, unrelated to the Trump administrations antipathy towards President Barack Obamas rapprochement with the island . Instead, the removal of staffers from the U.S. Embassy in Havana began in the spring and summer of that year in response to unexplained brain injuries suffered by American diplomats, spies and other government employees posted to the island. The Trump administration also moved to reverse many of the Obama administration's initiatives, reimposing restrictions that had barred direct commercial flights by U.S. carriers to multiple Cuban airports and port calls by U.S. registered cruise ships. As president Donald Trump also sharply curtailed remittances that Cuban Americans were allowed to send to relatives on the island, barred financial and commercial transactions with most Cuban companies affiliated with the government or military and, in his final days in office, redesignated Cuba a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" in part for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Biden said as a presidential candidate that he would revert to Obama-era policies that loosened decades of embargo restrictions on Havana, and the political right in the U.S. has accused him of not being supportive enough of Cuban dissidents. Thus far, the Biden administration has said its reviewing its Cuba policy and has done little to move away from Trumps posture toward the communist regime. Some of the more liberal members of the Democratic Party, most notably Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have criticized the Cuban government but also called on Biden to lift the embargo and argued that the embargo policy is contributing to Cuban suffering.",

WASHINGTON, D.C. - President Joe Biden talked about the economy and jobs on Monday from the White House while also addressing the historic protests in Washington, D.C., in support for the people of Cuba. He said he did hear South Floridians call for help, many of them showing up in the capital Saturday. There was plenty on the agenda Monday. Lawmakers continued to debate spending $4 trillion on Bidens infrastructure plan. Meanwhile, the president said that Tuesday will mark six months since his administration began. He touted that the U.S. went from creating 60,000 jobs per month to 60,000 jobs in three days. He spoke about the nations economic recovery amid the pandemic and the need for everyone to get the vaccine against the coronavirus. ""This virus doesnt have to hold you back any longer, it doesnt have to hold our economy back any longer,"" he said. He also added that investing in his infrastructure proposal would help the U.S. economy bounce back. And addressed concerns that his sweeping economic agenda will serve as an accelerant to inflation. Ad ""Weve seen some price increases. Some folks have raised worry that this could be a sign of persistent inflation, but thats not our view,"" Biden said. The president said experts and data show that price increases were expected and will be temporary. All of this as just outside the White House protests continued for the people of Cuba. We asked White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki if the president heard the people who made the 15-hour trek from Miami and throughout South Florida to Washington, D.C., over the weekend. ""The president has absolutely heard their call for help,"" Psaki said. ""He is engaged closely with his national security team, his administration team to think about the best ways we can help the people of Cuba."" And Psaki says the White House is now looking to see if they can offer humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba and possibly help get the internet back on as they have an ongoing review of their policies when it comes to Cuba.",
Biden orders review of remittances to Cuba,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/19/politics/cuba-remittances-biden/index.html,07/20/21,www.cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden has directed his administration to examine remittances to Cuba in the wake of protests on the island to determine ways for those residing in the US to send money to the country, a senior administration official told CNN. ""At President Biden's direction, the United States is actively pursuing measures that will both support the Cuban people and hold the Cuban regime accountable,"" the official said. The ""Remittance Working Group"" will work to ""identify the most effective way to get remittances directly into the hands of the Cuban people,"" the official said. Biden had said last week he believed that under the current circumstances, remittances -- the practice of Americans transferring money to their Cuban relatives -- would end up in the hands of the regime. But since then he's faced pressure to show solidarity with protesters. Cuba's government controls the financial sector on the island and all communications. Getting around the government to send money or improve internet access is a challenge other US administrations have tried and failed to overcome. Read More",
"Rubio blasts calls from AOC, Sanders to lift US embargo on Cuba",https://nypost.com/2021/07/20/rubio-blasts-calls-from-aoc-sanders-to-lift-us-embargo-on-cuba/,07/20/21,nypost.com,"Sen. Marco Rubio slammed calls Monday from socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to lift Americas decades-old embargo against Cuba, saying advocates of the policy change ""dont know what theyre talking about."" ""All they know is, theyre just spewing off a left-wing talking point, because if you notice, these are the same people that [say] over and over again, 'Its always Americas fault,'"" Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and a Republican from Florida, told Fox News ""Special Report"". ""No matter what problem there is in the world, Americas to blame for it. Americas done something wrong. They dont know what the heck theyre talking about,"" he added. After protesters calling for the overthrow of Cubas Communist regime took to the streets of Havana and other cities on July 11, Sanders tweeted that the embargo, which has been in place since 1962, had ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" Ocasio-Cortez remained silent until Thursday, when she issued a statement expressing ""solidarity"" with the Cuban people and condemning repression by the Havana government. She then turned her focus to the embargo, describing it as ""absurdly cruel"" and ""the US contribution to Cuban suffering."" ""It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day [sic] people,"" she said. Senator Bernie Sanders said the US embargo has ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" EPA ""Theres only two embargoes here,"" Rubio said Monday. ""The embargo against government-owned companies, and the embargo that the Cuban regime imposes on its own people. ""Right now, if an independent business operator, if a small farm owner, if a consultant or independent contractor in Cuba wants to do business with Americans, they can,"" the senator explained. ""Theres no [US government] restriction on that. Its the Cuban regime that doesnt allow it ... because they want to control how much money people make every month. Its the leverage they hold over their heads. The people who give these opinions dont know what theyre talking about."" The Associated Press reported late Monday that President Biden had ordered the State Department to look at increasing staff levels at the US Embassy in Havana in order to help boost engagement with ordinary Cubans following the protests. Biden also reportedly ordered the creation of a working group to review US remittance policy to ensure that money that Cuban-Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut. Rubio and other lawmakers have been urging the White House to work with Congress to help make the internet more accessible on the island after the Cuban government blocked social media sites during the protests. ""Cuba today is basically in a state of martial law,"" Rubio told host Bret Baier. ""In many of the major cities across the country, troops are stationed, security forces are stationed, and the message is clear: Theyre all continuing to repress people."" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the Cuban governments repression and the US embargo. Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA He added: ""These horrifying reports weve seen and have gotten -- of people being tortured, of people being abducted from their homes and family members not knowing where they are -- this is the model they have followed for a long time. The only difference between now and in the past is some of it is being documented and posted on social media for the world to see.""

Mothers of Cuban Protesters Plan Marches in Support of Their Missing Children,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/20/with-hundreds-missing-mothers-cuban-protesters-plan-march-justice/,07/20/21,www.breitbart.com,"The mothers of protesters missing since anti-communist marches erupted nationwide in Cuba on July 11 are planning to take the streets of the island on Wednesday demanding to know what the regime did to their children. The protest is expected to be the largest national anti-communist event within Cuba since the July 11 protests. International news outlets have struggled to document the ongoing protests since July 11 as the Castro regime shut down internet access nationwide following a rapid deluge of videos of police using live ammunition against unarmed protesters began to surface from the country. Assembly of the Cuban Resistance The Movement of July 11 Mothers, a newly formed support group, is reportedly organizing large-scale demonstrations against the regimes treatment of their children, who they assert are legitimate protesters and not ""delinquents"" as the communist authorities have described them, the independent outlet Cubanet - which had several of its journalists arrested over the past two weeks - reported. The group takes its name from the start date of the latest round of anti-communist protests on the island. The mothers aim to turn out large crowds in every Cuban province and to parade through Havana, beginning at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday. The group further advises local gatherings to take precautions against spreading the Chinese coronavirus, which has ravaged Cuba due to the regimes invitation of European tourists at the height of the first wave of the pandemic and its refusal to implement safety protocols in schools and at food ration lines. Eight days into the protests, the number of protesters wounded, arrested, killed, or disappeared remains unknown. Some human rights groups have compiled lists of individuals confirmed arrested or missing, with the caveat that many of those repressed may not have access to anyone in the outside world that could report their fate. At least 5,000 people had been arrested by July 14, three days into the protests, according to the independent Cuban news source 14 y Medio. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), a human rights group, managed to confirm at least 560 victims of this practice as of Saturday, listing them by name. Prominent dissidents, such as Jose Daniel Ferrer and artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom the regime has routinely jailed over the years, rank among the arrested, 14 y Medio noted. 14 y Medio noted the absence of any official figures and highlighted the range of estimates from human rights organizations, which assert the regimes victims number in the ""thousands."" The United Nations, in contrast, has identified at least 187 disappeared demonstrators. The lower figures represent only confirmed victims of the regime. Many more Cuban parents know nothing of their loved ones whereabouts or vital status. The government imposed an Internet blackout shortly after the initial outbreak of dissent and has actively suppressed information from reaching international audiences. Authorities have also violently attacked outside journalists for documenting the protests. Communist authorities last week brutally assaulted Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa, leaving him bloody. Beginning on July 11, thousands of Cubans took to the streets of San Antonio de los Banos unequivocally demanding an end to communism on the island. The protests quickly spread to every major city and shouts of ""Down with communism!"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" quickly became bywords of the movement. In response, ""President"" Miguel Diaz-Canel, the Castro regimes figurehead, called for Havana loyalists to take to the streets and attack the peaceful dissidents, issuing an ""order of combat"" during a bellicose speech on July 11. The subsequent crackdown saw police unleash live rounds on demonstrators in many instances, while other violent reprisals involved gruesome police beatings or the turning of attack dogs on the crowds. Cuban Prisoners Defenders, a human rights group advocating for the Castro regimes incarcerated dissidents, documented the crackdowns brutality and the regimes many crimes against the Cuban people in a Monday letter to the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, ADN Cuba reported. Civilian support for the Cuban people has exploded in the United States, especially in Florida, which boasts a large population of Cuban expats and their children. Large crowds turned out in Miami almost immediately after the protests began to express solidarity with the anti-communists on the island. On Saturday, protesters demanding action from Biden administration staged a ""die-in"" outside the White House during which they dressed in bloodstained communist school uniforms and played dead to represent Havanas countless victims. The responses from President Joe Biden and his administration, however, have ranged from apathetic to counterproductive. A day after the protests began, Washington announced it would lift sanctions against the socialist dictatorship in Venezuela, a de facto colony of communist Cuba that provides the Castro government with essentially free energy. On Monday, Biden held a Zoom call with several Cuban-American celebrities.",

""The United Nations &, very especially, the United States, must strongly condemn the repressive & violent measures being taken by the Cuban government against their own people! Spread the images, spread the word!"" she wrote. President Biden has faced pressure from the Cuban exile community to act in support of the people of Cuba, who are largely impoverished and unarmed save for rocks thrown in response to Cuban State Security officials opening fire on crowds of protesters. The Cuban Communist Party has ordered violent suppressions of recent protests and shut down the internet to stifle organization from the opposition. The Biden administration has struggled when addressing the widespread protests, falsely claiming they were in protest of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. After several days of criticism for his lackluster response to the protests, Biden publicly stated Thursday that communism was a ""failed system"" and that Cuba was ""repressing"" its citizens, but has yet to take any action.",

""The time is never right to attempt migration by sea,"" Mayorkas said at a press conference. ""To those who risk their lives doing so, this risk is not worth taking."" ""Allow me to be clear.

"With increasing defiance, Cuban churches urge government to listen, not repress",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/with-increasing-defiance-cuban-churches-urge-government-listen-not-repress-2021-07-20/,07/20/21,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA, July 20 (Reuters) - Cuba's churches have defended those who participated in unprecedented protests and even set up a hotline to advise the families of detainees, a sign of increasing boldness from spiritual leaders on the Communist-run island. Protests erupted nationwide on July 11 against shortages of medicine and food, power outages, the COVID-19 surge and curbs on freedom. The government blamed counter-revolutionaries it said were exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions. Hundreds of protesters, activists and journalists have since been detained, according to human rights groups. Authorities say they are prosecuting those who instigated ""unpatriotic unrest"" and committed vandalism. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register In the days following the protests, the dominant Roman Catholic church, other religions, and freemasons issued statements in favor of free expression. After decades of repression following the 1959 revolution, an expansion of religious freedoms in the 1990s has given religious groups greater autonomy than any other organization not affiliated with the Communist Party. But such candor is still rare in Cuba, where significant restrictions on dissent remain in place. ""Amid the difficulties, the protests of recent days and also the detentions, the repression, the Church wants to pray for all Cubans, for all Cuba,"" Dionisio Garcia, Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, the country's second largest city, said in a televised mass on Sunday. The Cuban people need changes to feel hope, he said at the Church of the Virgin of Charity of El Cobre, the patron saint of a country where an estimated 60% are baptized Catholics. Protestant denominations also backed the protesters' right to express themselves, with the Methodist Church stating in a post shared on social media on Saturday: ""The fact of disagreeing with the political system does not turn a person into an antisocial element or criminal."" All urged both protesters and authorities to avoid violence in favor of dialogue. The conference of Catholic bishops expressed concern the government's response would instead be ""immobility"" and even a ""hardening of positions."" The Catholic Church in particular has played an important role in Cuban society in recent years, negotiating the release of political prisoners and fomenting the 2014 detente with old Cold War foe the United States. But government critics have at times accused the Church of not doing enough to confront authorities over human rights, in favor of a fragile entente that allows them a seat at the table of power. That may be changing. In his weekly address to the faithful in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff, said he felt close to those families in Cuba suffering the most in these ""difficult moments"". ""I pray that the Lord might help the nation construct a society that is more and more just and fraternal through peace, dialogue and solidarity,"" he said. The Cuban Conference of Catholic Religious opened a helpline for those detained and their relatives on Sunday. ""This is focused on providing counsel for the presentation of habeas corpus, help in locating the detainees, and spiritual and psychological guidance for the relatives,"" it said. Meanwhile, Cuba's Grand Lodge of Freemasons - a secretive society that also has a broad reach - said in a statement it was ""concerned by the excessive use of force"" by authorities. Masonic leader Jose Ramon Vinas went a step further, writing a letter to President Miguel Diaz-Canel accusing the government of always justifying the country's problems through the U.S. trade embargo rather than recognizing its own responsibility. He wrote later on Facebook that had been summoned to a police station where three officials questioned him over the letter. In a show of the growing sense of defiance in Cuban society, he said he suggested they came to visit the masons instead where they could speak on an equal footing.

Lobbyist with Ties to Haiti Among Biden's Invitees to Cuba Zoom Call,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/20/democrat-lobbyist-ties-haiti-among-bidens-invitees-cuba-zoom-call/,07/20/21,www.breitbart.com,"President Joe Biden invited a lobbying firm executive with ties to Haiti who has not formally worked on Cuba issues for decades to join Cuban celebrities and businesspeople for a Zoom call on protests in the communist nation Tuesday. After a week of inaction following nationwide anti-government protests in Cuba, the Biden Administration finally acted by holding a ""listening session"" Zoom call featuring Gloria and Emilio Estefan, actor Andy Garcia, and several other prominent Cuban-Americans. The virtual meeting Tuesday included former Florida Rep. Joe Garcia (D), a co-chair for a lobbying firm that represents the office of the presidency of Haiti, Politico reported in July 2021. Garcia was once the head of a prominent Cuban-American organization, but his career has taken him far from the topic, raising questions as to why he was at the top of the list of Cuban voices for Biden to reach out to. The office of the presidency of Haiti is currently unoccupied. President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home this month. Haiti also currently lacks a parliament and only resolved its dueling prime minister crisis on Monday. Senior Advisor and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond, who once falsely claimed Republicans defunded the police, and Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere for the National Security Council Juan Gonzalez facilitated the call. The White Houses self-described ""listening session"" was held to hear ""policy recommendations"" and ""concerns"" from other Cuban-Americans like Garcia, including Gloria and Emilio Estefan, actress Carmen Pelaez, and actor Andy Garcia. Lawyers, CEOs, entrepreneurs, and former Obama Administration staffers were also on the call, according to CBS Miami. The White House just released a ""readout"" on a ""listening session"" with Cuban American leaders.

Moise reportedly hired the group in 2018 to repair Haitis image after Former President Donald Trump called the country a ""shithole"" during a White House meeting. Moise allegedly funneled money into lobbyist groups in an ""effort to get positive international press as detractors accuse(d) him of trying to install a dictatorship with autocratic policies,"" according to the Herald. Opponents protested the money could have gone to combating his countrys hunger crisis, rising crime and kidnappings, and rampant inflation. The U.S. State Department has accused the Haitian government of human rights abuses, including gang killings supported by unnamed officials, excessive use of force by police, arbitrary detentions, a corrupt judiciary system, violence against women, and ""the worst forms of child labor."" Moise denied allegations of being tied to the increasingly powerful gangs controlling the country. Following his death, however, one of those gang leaders -- Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Cherizier -- vocally defended Moise and accused his opposition of organizing an ""international conspiracy"" with Middle Eastern merchants to kill him. Moise took over for predecessor Michel Martelly in the aftermath of the chaotic 2015 elections as a placeholder president. He insisted that his term began in 2017, thus making him legitimate president through 2022, but faced opposition who claimed that his term had expired by this year and branded him a dictator, Breitbart News previously reported. He was assassinated in early July with no clear successor, and parliament in Haitis semi-presidential republic had already collapsed before his death. Moises death also catapulted the country into more political upheaval, with two people dueling for the countrys interim prime minister position. Garcias ties to Cuba policy are decades old. Garcia was named executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation around 2000 -- more than 20 years ago -- before serving as director in the Department of Energy under the Obama Administration in 2009. He also previously served as the first Democrat congressman for District 26 in Florida from 2013-2015, which includes a portion of Miami-Dade County. His stint as a congressman only lasted for one two-year term and was marred by the arrest of his staffer Jeffrey Garcia (no relation). Jeffrey Garcia received probation for funneling campaign money to a phony tea party candidate so he could siphon votes from a Republican rival, Politico reported. ""Joe Garcia denied any knowledge or involvement, but the FBI dug up an email indicating he might have been informed of the scheme,"" according to Politico. Jeffrey Garcia was also caught in a separate absentee-ballot request fraud scheme and served 90 days in jail in 2013. The White House call notably omitted all Cuban-American senators, former political prisoners residing in the United States, and leaders of humanitarian and human rights groups specializing in Cuban issues in Florida. In contrast, former President Donald Trump maintained ties to Cuban-American humanitarian groups and hosted victims of the Castro regime and Cuban dissident leaders with direct experiences in Cuba when he announced policy revisions toward Cuba in 2017. The Biden Administration has noticeably struggled in its messaging about Cuba since protests sparked on the island last week in more than 40 municipalities. White House press secretary Jen Psaki first asserted anti-government protesters were actually protesting the Chinese coronavirus pandemic before admitting ""communism is a failed ideology."" Biden delayed explicitly condemning communism for several days before finally calling Cuba a ""failed state."" Since protests in Cuba began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten people in the streets. Independent media confirmed the arrests of at least 5,000 people so far, Breitbart News reported. Current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued last week. Bidens move to consult celebrities comes soon after hundreds of demonstrators protested in front of the White House demanding U.S. military intervention in Cuba. The administration has reportedly been reviewing its policies toward Cuba and is considering providing humanitarian aid, though nothing has been done yet.",

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) HAVANA (AP) -- The COVID-19 pandemic is slamming Cuba like never before, even as the country races to roll out its homegrown vaccines -- the only locally developed shots being widely used in Latin America. The island had seen far fewer infections that most other Latin American nations over the first year or so of the disease, imposing strict quarantines, isolating the infected and shutting down its tourism industry despite devastating economic consequences. But new cases have been soaring in recent weeks, with an average of about 6,000 a day being reported in the country of 11 million people. The first three weeks of July have accounted for about 100,000 of the nearly 300,000 infections recorded altogether in Cuba since the first case arrived some 16 months ago. Cubas national director of epidemiology, Francisco Duran, said Tuesday that 717 people have died so far this month in Cuba -- a heavy share of the 2,019 who have died in all. ADVERTISEMENT Anxiety over that spread was one of the factors that fed into the wave of street protests that broke out across the country on July 11. Duran said transmission is ""very elevated"" now, especially in the central provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos and Ciego de Avila, as well as in Guantanamo, to the east. Theres also been a rise in Havana, the capital. ""Of course we are worried, because we see there is a high incidence in the population, above all in young children,"" said Yurizam Martinez, a 53-year-old nurse in Havana. ""I feel affected psychologically because we have been working for more than a year and we still dont see the result we had hoped for. ... But we have to keep on."" Cuba has been trying to rapidly roll out the two vaccines that it has approved for massive use, Abdala and Soberana, both of which require three jabs. The government reported that both, particularly Abdala, have proven highly effective. Duran said 18.8% of the population is already fully vaccinated and 30.1% has gotten at least one dose. Officials say they hope to have 80% vaccinated by the end of August, and children by September. The surge -- Cubas first real wave of the virus -- appeared to start slowly after some restrictions were relaxed around the start of the year and new variants began to spread around the world. Authorities blamed the delta variant for at least part of the problem in Matanzas, where hospitals were flooded with patients and authorities mobilized brigades of physicians to treat the ill. Pianist Regla de la Caridad Mesa, 60, said she trusted that the islands vaccine campaign will begin to lead to reduced deaths and critical cases.

WASHINGTON D.C. - The island nation of Cuba is facing a shortage when it comes to administering the COVID-19 vaccine. On Tuesday, thanks to thousands of generous citizens, the United States is lending a hand. Six million syringes of the coronavirus vaccine are on their way to Cuba after half a million dollars was donated, five times the goal of $100,000 that organizers had hoped to reach. ""The donations pouring in from Hialeah, from Miami from Fort Lauderdale from the places where Cuban Americans lives,"" said organizer Medea Benjamin. The vaccines should make a big difference for those in Cuba amid the pandemic and with the new Delta Variant spreading. ""These syringes will allow Cubans to continue to inoculate and vaccinate its population,"" said Felix Sharpe-Caballero with the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign. The donation comes on the heels of days of protests for the people of Cuba and a call for President Biden to help. Ad Cuba is also not working with an international organization, or NGA, that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday could, without fear of corruption, distribute doses. ""We would be happy to (send Cuba doses of the vaccine), we would love to get vaccines into the hands of the Cuban people. Cuba has not joined Covax,"" she said. This information coming as the White House ordered a review of US-Cuba policies. A senior administration official said the US is actively pursuing measures that will both support the Cuban people and hold the communist regime accountable for violence, repression and human rights violations. Representatives from the Embassy of Cuba in Washington D.C. pushed back though, blaming the embargo. ""The main cause for these difficulties are caused by again the 243 measures imposed by the past administration,"" said Rodney Gonzalez with the Cuban Embassy.",

Biden called the Communist-run country a ""failed state"" that is ""repressing their citizens"", dashing hopes he could lift crippling sanctions any time soon that have contributed to Cubas worst econonomic crisis in decades. Biden, a Democrat, had vowed during his presidential campaign to ease some of the sanctions on Cuba tightened by his predecessor Donald Trump, a Republican. But analysts say the protests have complicated his political leeway to do so. ""A failed state is that which, to please a reactionary and blackmailing minority, is capable of doing damage to 11 million humans,"" Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. Cuban officials and many analysts charge that U.S. policy on Cuba is driven by the anti-Communist Cuban-American community that has a strong influence on the swing state of Florida, not the interests of the Cuban people.

Those in attendance will include political and community leaders as well as artists. Thousands of Cubans throughout the island took to the streets July 11 and showed a level of dissent not seen since the 1959 revolution. The protests were sparked by the islands severe economic crisis, including shortages in food and medicine, as well as rolling blackouts, but also included calls for ""libertad"" or ""freedom."" Many chanted ""we want change"" and ""down with the dictatorship."" The protests ended with security forces and civilians with sticks beating protesters and arrests.

"As Cubans protest, government cracks down on internet access and messaging apps",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cubans-protest-government-cracks-internet-access-messaging-apps-rcna1400,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"As protests grip Cuba, the country's government has taken steps to block citizens use of the encrypted chat apps WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, researchers say. The entire country went offline for more than 30 minutes on Sunday, according to researchers who study internet censorship. Since then, virtual private networks, which are tools used to reroute internet traffic that can circumvent some internet censorship, and popular communication apps in Cuba have been blocked. Cubans have taken to the streets since Sunday to protest against the government in the midst of an economic downturn and a major health crisis, as the country still struggles to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters have organized online and shared videos of police detentions. But since the protests began, the country has experienced widespread online censorship. Various governments including those in Venezuela and Iran have in recent years sought to limit or block internet access during protests. Widespread internet use in Cuba is still relatively new, and Cubans mostly reach the web through their smartphones. The country only has a single major internet provider, the national telecommunications company ETECSA. That means most Cubans have to rely on a single, centralized, government-affiliated hub, making government censorship substantially easier. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring company, said Monday that it had detected disruptions to multiple messaging apps through ETECSAs service. ETECSA did not respond to a request for comment, and has not made a public statement about the outages. A number of messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, are all blocked in Cuba, said Arturo Filasto, the project lead at the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI). OONI, an international nonprofit, relies on volunteers around the world to install a program that probes for which types of internet use are being censored and how. Its data showed that ETECSA began blocking WhatsApp on Sunday night, then Signal and Telegram on Monday. All three were still blocked on Tuesday, Filasto said. ""We have never seen instant messaging apps being blocked in the country,"" he said. ""Its sort of unprecedented that we would see such a heavy crackdown on the internet in Cuba."" Marianne Diaz Hernandez, a fellow at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, said some Cubans have reported that their specific SIM cards for their phones have been rendered useless, keeping them offline. And some virtual private networks have themselves been blocked, she said. Two major VPNs, Tor and Psiphon, appear to still work. While Cuba has deployed various censorship techniques in the past, this is the first time they have all been deployed at the same time, Hernandez said. ""Since they have had internet, this is the largest blackout in history,"" she said. Grisel Martin, a native of the Cuban city of Matanzas who lives in Miami, said that the blackout has kept her from communicating with family there. ""The latest news I got from them was Sunday, July 11, 5:10 p.m. through WhatsApp, saying that my aunt had a fever the previous night,"" Martin said. ""We feel so desperate and powerless,"" she said.

""We also have to make a critical analysis of our own problems so we can act, so we can overcome, and prevent them from repeating themselves, so we can transform situations,"" Diaz-Canel said during a speech on Wednesday. He also doubled down on previous comments about the protests being orchestrated by the United States. He said the U.S. embargo limits what they can achieve and called it ""cruel"" and ""genocidal."" Some of those who participated, he said, ""respond to a foreign plan, that are irreconcilably against the Cuban revolution, and dont think like Cubans. They think under the guises of the empire,"" he said, referring to the United States. He said other groups that were involved in the protests included ""delinquents, ""unsatisfied people"" and ""young people."" Cuba's prime minister, Manuel Marrero, who also spoke Wednesday, said that starting Monday until the end of the year, the government would lift restrictions on the amount of food and medicine that travelers are allowed to bring into the country. This had been a demand on social media among many Cubans using the hashtag #SOSCuba before the protests erupted. However, Cuba has limited the amount of flights to Cuba, particularly from the United States, in an attempt to reduce the amount of Covid-19 infections circulating on the island. The island has been grappling with a record number of cases and deaths recently. Thousands spontaneously took to the streets Sunday that have caught the attention of the world after decades of relatively little or no unrest. The lifting of restrictions on food and medicine is a small step considering the demands that protesters have been making, including calls for an end to over 60 years of communist rule. Diaz-Canel said Wednesday that the country lacked a ""tremendous amount of hard currency so we always have an enormous list of what the country needs."" The tipping point for many Cubans was the dire economic crisis they are facing that includes acute shortages in food and medicine, increasing prices due to inflation, and 12-hour blackouts in the sweltering heat. Among the many chants Cubans could be heard demanding ""freedom,"" ""we want change,"" and ""homeland and life."" Police cracked down on protests that had carried over to Monday, while authorities blocked social media and messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. On Wednesday people were beginning to access these apps again. Internationally, calls from human rights groups, the United Nations, and several countries have grown louder, demanding Cubas government to be more tolerant of demonstrations and for police to use less force. Cubans living abroad in Spain, Mexico and other countries have broken out into protests and rallies in support of their relatives back home. At a protest rally in Miami on Wednesday, the heart of the exile community, the group Gente de Zona performed their song ""Patria y Vida"" or ""Homeland and Life"" that has become a sort of anthem for those in Cuba demanding liberty. The title of the song is a play on the socialist revolutionary slogan ""patria or muerte"" or ""homeland or death"" that Cubans grew up with.

Mexico president: Sending fuel cargo for Cuba is their sovereign decision,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexico-president-sending-fuel-cargo-cuba-sovereign-decision-rcna1533,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"MEXICO CITY -- Mexicos president asserted his countrys right to send fuel to Cuba and said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions on the island were ""inhumane,"" after a diesel cargo shipped by Mexicos state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos arrived in Cubas Havana port. Mexicos left-leaning President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has criticized the U.S. embargo against Cuba and pledged support for the Communist-run island, which has been hit by a surge in coronavirus infections and an economic slump that triggered rare protests this month. A shipment of humanitarian aid departed from the Mexican port of Veracruz on Tuesday destined for Cuba, and another is scheduled to set sail on Wednesday, carrying food, oxygen tanks and other medical supplies, Mexicos foreign ministry said in a release. Members of the Mexican Navy load humanitarian aid including medical supplies for Cuba in Veracruz, Mexico, on July 24, 2021. Victor Yanez / AFP - Getty Images ""We are an independent nation,"" Lopez Obrador said at a news conference in response to a question about whether deliveries risked contravening the U.S. embargo on the Communist-run island. Lopez Obrador criticized policies he said made it difficult for ships that delivered goods to Cuba to then dock in U.S. ports, which constitutes one of the main aspects of the embargo. Mexicos foreign ministry said the aid is part of a cooperation agreement between Mexico and Cuba. Authorities in Havana have long said the decades-old U.S. embargo on Cuba has caused widespread hardship on the island, where thousands took to the streets this month in the protests. Cuban Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca welcomed on Monday Mexicos pledge of two shipments of aid: ""We are not alone,"" he said on Twitter. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment and the State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment. John S. Kavulich, president of New-York based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said there were no specific U.S. sanctions preventing the sale -- or donation -- of Mexican fuel to Cuba. ""The U.S. embargo on Cuba is not focused on Cubas imports but on U.S exports to Cuba,"" Kavulich said, adding that the Caribbean island did not appear to be a foreign policy priority for U.S. President Joe Biden. Lopez Obrador, who on Monday called on Biden to ""make a decision"" about the ""inhumane"" embargo on Cuba, last week had anticipated that Mexico would send fuel to generate electricity for the islands hospitals. The Jose Maria Morelos II, a tanker owned and managed by a Pemex unit, departed last week from the Mexican port of Coatzacoalcos bound for the Caribbean, according to Refinitiv Eikon tanker monitoring data. The vessel, which is carrying some 100,000 barrels of diesel according to the foreign ministrys release, has not updated its port of destination, but it docked at the Havana port late on Monday, the Eikon data showed. It is yet unclear which Cuban entity will receive the fuel. Cubas dependence on diesel has increased in recent years as power plants using fuel oil and crude have been in urgent need of investment and maintenance. The island is also struggling to supply power plants with natural gas, said Jorge Pinon from the University of Texas at Austin. An oil-for-services arrangement between Venezuela and Cuba ran afoul of U.S. sanctions on the South American oil producer when in 2019 the U.S. Department of Treasury blacklisted a group of tanker owners and vessels involved in the shipments, at the Venezuelan oppositions request. Cubas economy has been damaged by Venezuelas collapse, along with a slump in tourism following the global coronavirus pandemic. Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

Cuba battles highest Covid-19 caseload in Latin America,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-battles-highest-covid-19-caseload-latin-america-rcna1453,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"HAVANA -- Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, now has the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare protests that have roiled the Communist-run island. The Caribbean nation of 11 million people reported nearly 4,000 confirmed cases per million residents over the last week, nine times more than the world average and more than any other country in the Americas for its size. The outbreak, fueled by the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant first identified in India, has pushed hospitals at the virus epicenter in the province of Matanzas to the brink. State media has shown rare images of patients in beds in corridors and doctors complaining of a lack of oxygen, ventilators and medicines. Cubas handling of the pandemic was one of the issues that propelled thousands to take to the streets nationwide last Sunday in unprecedented anti-government demonstrations in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. Demonstrators also protested shortages of food and medicines and curbs on civil liberties. Cuba is not alone in struggling under new waves of the pandemic. But the political implications of such a crisis are greater in a country where healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of its ""revolutionary"" one-party system. Moreover the outbreak and subsequent lockdown and reduction in numbers of flights has taxed an already bankrupt economy where many work in tourism and others rely on travelers to bring in remittances and goods including medicine. ""The government has consistently made the case that one of the main accomplishments of the revolution is its world-class medical sector,"" said Cuban American historian Daniel Rodriguez, author of a book on medical politics in post-independence Havana. Rodriguez said the exacerbation of food and medicine shortages over the past year due to the pandemic-related economic crisis had already broken Cubas social pact. ""When the pandemic began spiraling out of control a couple of weeks ago, it appeared increasingly the revolutionary government was no longer able to protect Cuban lives, and the result was an extraordinary repudiation of the revolution itself."" ""Not even medicine"" Cubas government has blamed the demonstrations on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardships caused by decades-old U.S. sanctions tightened during the pandemic. Several countries and non-government organizations including Oxfam called on Washington to lift sanctions this week. On Saturday, authorities organized pro-government rallies across the island attended by thousands. But many Cubans have aimed their anger at their own governments handling of the economy and the pandemic. ""We are hungry, theres nothing at the moment, not even medicine,"" said Aylin Sardina, 33, at a protest in Havana. Some critics complained that the authorities appeared to have ample transport to deploy security forces to quell protests and bus state workers to rallies, while lacking ambulances. To be sure, Cuba has had some pandemic successes, notably the development of five vaccine candidates, two of which have proven to have efficacy of more than 90%,according to preliminary Cuban data. read more Thanks to one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita rates in the world, it was also able to send its ""white coat army"" to help other countries, and lately to reinforce hospitals in Matanzas. Moreover cumulative cases per capita are still below the global average, while deaths per capita, though rising, are still just a third of the global average, a fact Cuba credits to its experimental treatments and its free, universal healthcare. However, with cases now rising fast, a deepening of Cubas economic crisis has prevented officials from imposing stricter lockdowns with many Cubans having to stand in lines for hours to get scarce goods. And so far only some two million people -- less than a fifth of the population -- are fully vaccinated. Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol said that premature triumphal statements from state media about the Cuban vaccine candidates and rallies like Saturdays may have also led to people lowering their guard, creating a breeding ground for cases to soar. The country has an ambitious aims to have fully vaccinated 70 percent of the population by September. But Perez Riverol warned that in the next few weeks COVID-19 deaths would likely continue to rise as they lagged the surge in cases. ""You go out onto the street to buy food and someone says to you: do you know who else died?"" said Libia Ortega, 44, a worker in a private cafeteria in Matanzas city closed due to the pandemic and shortages of products.

While Cubans expressed anger over shortages in food and medicine, rising inflation and power outages -- amid the challenges of Covid-19 -- many of the chants throughout the island called for political change and included expressions such as ""libertad"" (liberty), ""We want change"" and ""Down with the dictatorship."" Many Cuban Americans say that should not be glossed over. ""For the first time in 62 years, they are risking their lives from one end of the island to the other to demand accountability from the regime,"" Carmen Pelaez, a Cuban American filmmaker and Democratic political consultant, said. ""Im anti-embargo. But its not about the embargo right now. Thats not what this fight is about."" In the U.S., Cuban Americans hold different positions on U.S.-Cuba relations, some falling along party lines. But while conservatives and Republicans are known for a more hard-line stance against Cuba, some progressives have been denouncing the Cuban governments tough stance against activists' calls for greater freedom of expression. Many Cuban Americans have grown up hearing calls for ""libertad"" for Cuba in the streets of Miami and other U.S. cities, but its seldom heard in Cuba. Some Cuban Americans said it was emotional to hear the word being shouted by so many on the island. ""Policy differences aside, Cuban Americans strongly agree and understand that these protests are not about the embargo or even food shortages. Its opposition to the regime,"" said Giancarlo Sopo, a conservative media strategist. ""It doesnt matter if youre a Republican or a Democrat. We all recognize what these protests are about,"" said Sopo, adding that the chants called for ""libertad."" Cuba has been run by a Communist government, with a strong grip on society, for over six decades. Though the government has received praise for its ability to offer primary care to its population, it also determines many aspects of peoples lives, including wages, food and internet prices, as well as their freedom of assembly, expression and the ability to choose a president that does not belong to the Communist Party of Cuba. After the protests, Cubas government announced it would temporarily lift restrictions on the amount of toiletries, food and medicine that Cuban citizens can bring back home when they take foreign trips, but for many protesters on the island its a small concession compared to their demands, and out of touch with their basic needs. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel took some blame for the protests recently, saying failings by the government played a role, though he still says the United States is primarily at fault. Before the protests began on Sunday, public displays of dissent had been increasing in recent months. In November, authorities broke up a hunger strike by members of the San Isidro Movement, an artists collective, sparking a rare protest with hundreds of artists and activists in front of the Culture Ministry. Those who protested formed another group, called 27N. The leader of the San Isidro Movement, Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, went on a hunger strike in May and was forcibly taken to the hospital on the seventh day, drawing international attention and condemnation. Following the protests, the government faced scrutiny over its shutdown of social media and messaging apps. The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, on Friday urged Cubas government to address protesters grievances and called for the prompt release of all those detained. ""I am very concerned at the alleged use of excessive force against demonstrators in Cuba and the arrest of a large number of people, including several journalists,"" Bachelet said in a statement. ""It is particularly worrying that these include individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown."" The streets of the capital, Havana, have been calm in recent days but a heavy police presence remains. Since Sundays protests, 55 out of 383 people who were detained nationwide have been freed, according to Cubalex, a human rights group based in the U.S. The words ""Cuba Libre"" or ""free Cuba"" was painted in large block letters on the street in directly in front of the Cuban embassy in Washington D.C. on Friday. For Cuba's government, the challenge will be to manage the acute economic crisis and the pandemic, while addressing human rights concerns and growing calls for ""libertad"" in Cuba and abroad. Cuban American musician Pitbull said in a widely shared video on Twitter that he felt frustrated ""having a platform to speak to the world and not being able to help my own people, not being able to get them food, not being able to get them water, not being able to get them medicine. But most of all, not being able to help and really get them what they deserve, which is freedom."" Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
Cuba starts handing out sentences following historic protests,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-starts-handing-sentences-historic-protests-rcna1481,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"HAVANA -- An anti-government hip hop song by some of Cubas most popular musicians in exile became the anthem of the unprecedented protests that rocked the Communist-run country last week. Now the visual artist who filmed the Cuban section of the videoclip for ""Patria y Vida"" ('Homeland and Life), Anyelo Troya, 25, has been sentenced to a year in prison, according to relatives. He was charged with instigating unrest, they said, after attending a demonstration in Havana. Rights activists say this is just the start of what they predict will be a wave of summary trials of hundreds of people detained during and after the unusual protests on July 11 and 12 that the government has blamed on U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. ""They took him to trial without defense or lawyer or anything,"" Troyas mother Raisa Gonzalez told Reuters after witnessing his sentencing in what she called a collective trial of around a dozen people. The Cuban Foreign Ministrys International Press Center, which fields all requests from foreign journalists for comment from state entities, did not immediately reply to request for comment on the cases mentioned in this article. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday they had started the trials of those detained on charges of instigating unrest, committing vandalism, propagating the coronavirus pandemic, or assault, charges that could carry prison sentences of up to 20 years. ""There are people who will receive the response that Cuban legislation allows for, and it will be energetic,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on state television last week. He promised there would be due legislative procedure. But Gonzalez said she was not informed of her sons trial in time and when she arrived at the court with her lawyer, he had already been convicted. The trial was denounced by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) for taking place without proper defense or due process. Troya had already been under heightened vigilance for his participation in the song, whose headline is a twist on the revolutionary slogan 'Patria o Muerte ('Homeland or Death), his mother said. Javier Larrondo, a representative of the human rights organization Cuban Prisoners Defenders, said authorities would likely lock up the most charismatic and effective opposition leaders, who lately have often been young artists, whether or not they were at the protests. ""We will have hundreds of political prisoners in just two weeks,"" he said. The protests against Cubas worst economic crisis in decades and curbs on civil liberties first erupted ten days ago in a small town before spreading throughout the country. By the evening of day two, they appeared to have dissipated amid heavy security operations and internet disruptions. The government blamed mercenaries exploiting frustrations with hardships caused by U.S. sanctions. Exiled rights group Cubalex, which has established a spreadsheet of those detained that it updates every day as new reports come in, says more than 500 Cubans appear to have been detained during the protests or afterwards. It said the tally was likely higher, but some families may fear reporting the arrest of relatives in case of reprisals such as losing their state sector jobs. Some of those detained, like theater director Yunior Garcia, have been released to house arrest. ""I have four officials in front of my door preventing me going out,"" Garcia told Reuters, which observed the officials. ""When I go to buy food or cigarettes, one of them goes with me to keep a close eye on me."" The majority of those detained have been kept incommunicado, while the location of some is still unknown, said Cubalex and HRW, based on interviews with relatives. Cubans have been posting photos of people they say they cannot locate or sharing stories of detentions on a Facebook group called 'Disappeared #SOSCuba with more than 10,000 members. ""We went from police station to police station looking for her,"" said Alberto Betancourt of his sister, a stay-at-home mother-of-two who was detained at a protest in Havana. He located her after six days. ""They wont let me speak to her,"" he told Reuters, holding back tears. ""But shes not a criminal. She just let herself be swept up in the crowds."" Cuban interior ministry officials denied on Tuesday that anyone was missing and said a list of detainees circulating -- they did not specify which -- was manipulated and included people who were never detained. The detained include high profile dissidents like Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who also featured in ""Patria y Vida,"" and Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the countrys largest opposition group. They also include ordinary citizens and bystanders, families and rights groups say. Many of those detained had been beaten or mistreated by security forces or rapid-reaction brigades -- government-organized bands of civilian recruits, said HRW senior researcher Juan Pappier. Used to quiet streets, Cubans have been shocked over the last week by images of violence that have emerged on social media: security forces and bands of stick-wielding people in civilian garb beating protesters, as well as protesters throwing stones at police and overturning police cars. Diaz-Canel said last week ""maybe there will be a need for apologies to anyone who, in the middle of all the confusion, has been mistreated,"" and defended security forces actions to re-establish ""peace.""

Black Lives Matter faces backlash for statement on Cuba protest,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-lives-matter-faces-backlash-statement-cuba-protest-rcna1438,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation is facing backlash after calling for the end of the U.S. governments embargo on Cuba while praising the country for its ""solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent"" amid historic anti-government protests. In the statement shared Thursday on social media, the organization urged the U.S. to lift the embargo immediately and appeared to praise the country. ""The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,"" the message read. The statement has drawn the ire of academics and organizers who say that while the decadeslong embargo should be lifted, the statement both lets the Cuban government off the hook for its own history of systemic racism and ignores the protesters demands for change. ""It was surprising to me that Black Lives Matter came out with a statement focusing solely on the U.S. and not talking about why all of those folks are protesting, not coming out in solidarity of Black folks on the ground who are protesting,"" said Danielle Clealand, associate professor of Mexican American and Latina/o studies at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of ""The Power of Race in Cuba."" ""Its just disappointing that the statement took this kind of stance that 'This is all the U.S. when we know there is a lack of civil liberties in Cuba. We know that Cuba has a history of anti-Black racism."" In an email to NBC News, Black Lives Matter officials said their statement was ""grounded in our unequivocal support for Cuba,"" and vowed to amplify the voices of Afro-Cuban protesters protesting oppression ""from all actors, including the United States Embargo."" ""We unequivocally join in solidarity with the Cuban people against repression and violence from internal and unseen external actors,"" officials said in the statement. ""We also understand that Anti-Blackness exists within Cuba and is a Global issue. We struggle for and alongside Black people across the diaspora for liberation and self-sovereignty."" In its original message, BLM noted that Black and brown people make up a large portion of the Cuban population. The country's 2012 Census reported that Black people made up 9.3 percent of Cubas 11.1 million population. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in an unprecedented demonstration on Sunday to protest the government amid severe economic shortages and Covid-19 deaths. People have protested in solidarity around the world, including in New York, New Jersey and Miami -- which all have large Cuban American populations. During demonstrations in Cuba, protestors demanded ""libertad"" -- freedom -- and shouted ""down with the dictatorship."" Cubans have endured food and medicine shortages, severe inflation, power outages and limited access to basic supplies. And the pandemic has only exacerbated the countrys economic crisis. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, which was tightened by the Trump administration. However, critics say the matter is much more complicated and accused the Cuban government of using the embargo to distract from its own actions. Activists, organizers and economists alike have criticized the embargo and the countrys Soviet-style, centrally planned economy, holding that both are to blame for the country's problems. ""Reforms in Cuba do not depend on the embargo, and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally, independently from reforms in Cuba. Both cause problems,"" Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia, previously told NBC News. As for Black Lives Matter, Clealand said the statement missed the mark not because it took aim at the U.S. embargo, but because it failed to also address the concerns of Cubans protesting their own government. Afro-Cubans have routinely been pushed to the margins in the country, with only 11 percent of Black Cubans reporting owning a bank account and 70 percent of Black and mixed-race Cubans saying they didnt have internet access, according to The New York Times. Meanwhile, scholars have fought for years to have Afro-Cuban history taught in schools. ""You have to talk to folks on the ground before you make statements about them. I think thats what a lot of Black Cubans feel frustrated about,"" Clealand said. ""Theres not one position on the revolution within Cuba, particularly among Black folks. There are Black folks that have been longtime supporters of the revolution that feel like they must critique the way the revolution has ignored racism and not centered Black folks."" ""Theres a lot of nuance there that the statement misses,"" she continued. ""Folks on the ground are fighting for freedom, and theyre not talking about the U.S. embargo. The embargo is widely hated in Cuba, but its really not the center so the statement ... tries to put all the onus on the United States when we have to also pay attention to how the policies in Cuba affect Black folks."" Black Cuban organizations in the country have done their best to send out their own messages in the wake of the protests. Alianza Afro-Cubana, an advocacy organization for Black LGBTQ Cubans, said in a social media statement that the Cuban government ""should listen to the people, serve them"" instead of criminalizing them. The group called on Black Lives Matter to ""sit down and have a conversation about solidarity."" ""We call on activists and anti racist groups to be concerned about the situation of Black people, who bear the heaviest burden of violence,"" the statement reads. ""Cuba continues to show its racist reality and that justice has a selective condition."" Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
'We are no longer afraid': Thousands of Cubans protest against the government,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/-are-no-longer-afraid-thousands-cubans-protest-government-rcna1386,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"Thousands of Cubans took to the streets across the country on Sunday in an unusual protest in which civilians shouted slogans against the Communist government, such as ""We want freedom"" and ""We are no longer afraid."" The demonstrations came at a time when Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, an increase in repression against political opponents and a strained health system during a critical stage of the pandemic. Health authorities reported almost 7,000 new cases and 47 deaths -- a record for infections and deaths on the Caribbean island of just over 11 million people. In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba. ""I know my family in Cuba is struggling, people are dying. Its terrible,"" Miami resident Christian Guzman told NBC station WTVJ. ""Right now its hard. Theres no food, theres no medicine. The Covid outbreak. The whole country is in the streets,"" another Miami resident, Dario Suarez, said. People take part in a demonstration in Havana, on July 11, 2021. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images In Cuba, the protests began early Sunday afternoon in the municipality of San Antonio de los Banos, in the Artemisa province, adjacent to Havana. A few hours later they had spread to the east of the country, in provinces such as Santiago de Cuba. The central Malecon of the capital, where in August 1994 Cubans staged a historic protest against then-leader Fidel Castro that was violently repressed, also saw hundreds of protesters gather on Sunday. Cubans in several provinces contacted by Noticias Telemundo confirmed that the government, which controls the only internet provider company on the island, has caused service outages to prevent live broadcasts. ""They do not want the world to see what is happening in Cuba,"" said a resident from Havana who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals from the regime. President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on national television to call on the Army to confront the protesters: ""The order to fight has been given,"" he said. In Cuba, videos broadcast on social networks, which could be verified by Noticias Telemundo, show special agents known in Cuba as Black Berets, being deployed in some localities and violently detaining civilians who protested and sang peacefully. Diaz-Canel also called ""all the revolutionaries in the country, all the communists, to take to the streets and go to the places where these provocations are going to take place."" In recent days, Cuban exiles and high-profile personalities have joined the #SOSCuba campaign to demand that the islands authorities open a humanitarian channel that allows the entry of medicines and supplies to treat the almost 240,000 patients with coronavirus. The authorities have mocked the initiative on national television and described it as an attempt to discredit the governments management of the health crisis, which has the islands hospitals on the edge. Cubans whose relatives have died from coronavirus in recent days have gone on social networks to talk about the seriousness of the health crisis, which currently has its epicenter in the province of Matanzas, known for Varadero, a popular beach resort town. ""My mother just died. We were in isolation for four days. Four days calling the SIUM (Integrated System of Medical Emergencies) to come and look for her. Four days and the SIUM did not arrive,"" said Magdiel Matos outside a hospital in Matanzas. Opposition artists and independent journalists have said for weeks that the government has maintained police patrols outside their homes, while reports persist of patients who could not be transferred to hospitals on time due to lack of transportation and resources. ""Take these patrols to transport the sick, open the hotels to house them, facilitate the arrival of donated medicines and medical utensils,"" poet and activist Katherine Bisquet said from Havana, pointing out a police car stationed in the basement of the building. Cuba did not join COVAX, the World Health Organization agency that seeks to disseminate Covid-19 vaccines in poorer countries, instead betting on the production of its own vaccines. One of those five vaccine candidates, Abdala, received approval for emergency use this week. The government has stated that the vaccine, the first produced in Latin America, is 92.8 percent effective after three doses, but has not published data on clinical studies and it hasn't received the approval of any international health organization. In Miami, with the largest community of Cuban exiles in the U.S., Cuban-born congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar said, ""We have not seen in recent years a popular uprising as big as this one."" Mass protests are rare on the island and, when they do occur, they are quickly put down. Cuban politicians and the official press, the only one allowed by law in Cuba, often discredit dissidents by saying that they respond to the interests of the United States and that they receive funding for subversion. The acting deputy secretary of the U.S. State Departments Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Julie Chung, defended the protests on Twitter, saying that peaceful protests were growing as people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express their concern over the increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The coronavirus crisis, which caused the closure of airports and slowed tourism by more than 80 percent -- Cubas second source of income after its medical missions -- has exacerbated the shortage and fueled popular discontent. The Cuban government attributes the economic crisis to U.S. embargo against Cuba and sanctions, which former President Donald Trump intensified. The Biden Administration has shown no signs of wanting to roll back sanctions, instead demanding that the government release political prisoners and respect dissenting voices. An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.",
Are protests 'the beginning of the end' for Cuba's communist government?,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/are-protests-beginning-end-cubas-communist-government-rcna1460,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"The historic and spontaneous protests that rocked Cuba on July 11 took the communist government -- and the international community -- by surprise in terms of their intensity and numbers. Many analysts concur there probably wont be any immediate changes to the countrys one-party communist rule. But experts said its a watershed moment that marks a ""before"" and ""after"" the protests -- and they have put an enormous amount of pressure on the government to speed up reforms. While people across Cuba protested shortages of food and medicine amid a higher number of Covid-19 cases, rising prices due to inflation and hourslong power outages, many also chanted ""libertad"" (freedom) and ""We want change,"" while holding signs that read, ""Down with the dictatorship."" In a country like Cuba where the government has significant control over many aspects of life, including industries, wages, imports and prices of goods, its all intertwined. Independent journalist Yoani Sanchez tweeted, ""We were so hungry, we ate our fear."" Were the protests significant enough to change the countrys one-party political system? ""I think some caution is in order,"" said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University. He said what was remarkable about the protests was that they could not have been predicted and they were decentralized in the way they unfolded. ""It wasnt called for by the opposition, let alone the government. It just kind of happened,"" Bustamante said. ""I think that supposes real challenges if you wanted to channel this into something. How do you do that?"" Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former analyst with Cubas Interior Ministry and assistant professor at Holy Names University, said he does not expect any major political changes in the short term. But he added that the protests do put pressure on the government ""to make economic changes and to liberalize the politics within the one-party system."" In other words, Lopez-Levy said, it could open the door for more than one candidate to run within their one-party system by allowing an independent candidate to run, similar to how Iran allows moderate and conservative candidates to run in their elections. Other changes could potentially include transferring responsibilities from the central government to the provinces and requiring authorities to identify where arrested people are taken, something that was approved in the 2019 constitution that authorities are not currently complying with. The protests rattled the government. Raul Castro -- the 90-year-old brother of the late Fidel Castro who recently retired as head of the Communist Party -- emerged from retirement to attend a mass government rally. President Miguel Diaz-Canel went as far as to take some blame for the current crisis, but only after he called on government supporters to go out and fight during the protests. The call to combat further riled many Cubans. Cubas government has repeatedly blamed the U.S. governments decades-old economic embargo as a catalyst for the conditions and shortages that have led to the historic protests. The harsh response against the protesters by police and civilian supporters armed with sticks has drawn international condemnation from the United Nations, governments and rights groups in a way not seen in years. Supporters of the Cuban government participate in a demonstration in Havana on Saturday. Adalberto Roque / AFP - Getty Images After more than 60 years of revolution and U.S. sanctions, Cubas buildings are crumbling and at times collapsing, and over 60 percent of the food is imported. This year, the island produced the lowest amount of sugar, an export the island used to rely on heavily, since 1908. For years, Cubans seeking a better life immigrated to other countries. But for the first time, Cubans, particularly younger generations, are seeking change inside Cuba, putting a level of pressure on the government not seen before in communist Cuba, and it comes at a time when there are no Castros in power. ""I dont know how many times in my life I have heard the prediction that this [communism] is coming to an end,"" said former Cuban diplomat Jesus Arboleya, a professor at the University of Havana. He said no one can deny there is significant opposition in Cuba. ""The problem is finding a way to channel those discrepancies or that opposition through better channels,"" he said. People have drawn comparisons between Cubas protests and demonstrations that erupted in Venezuela and Nicaragua, close allies of the Caribbean island. Venezuela has a more organized opposition with a leader, Juan Guaido, and theyve held massive, sustained protests in past years. During 2018 anti-government protests in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortegas government responded violently with force. In both cases, scores were killed, and the leaders still have a firm grip on power. A woman holds a flag with the image of the late Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara during an act of revolutionary reaffirmation in Havana on Saturday. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images ""Whats different about the protests in Cuba by comparison to those in Venezuela and Nicaragua is that Cubans have been operating in a closed and repressive system for decades,"" said Paul J. Angelo, a fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. In other Latin American countries, protest movements have been common and recurring since the countries transitioned to authoritarian rule. ""Just as democratization processes across Latin America followed different paths and responded to different internal and external inducements during the 1980s and 1990s,"" Angelo said, ""so too will the democratization processes of the 2020s -- if we can achieve them."" Analysts agree the Cuban government will speed up economic reforms -- such as more foreign investment -- that had been promised by then-President Raul Castro but not fully implemented. How far these reforms go and whether they include political changes could depend on whether demonstrators keep the pressure and momentum that stunned so many on July 11.

"Cuban opposition websites, emboldened by protests, roil government",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuban-opposition-websites-emboldened-protests-roil-government-rcna1451,07/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miamis Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cubaa expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government. One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cubas government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba. Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio. The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations. While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access. Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. That would mean 20% of Cubas estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. ""Impossible delusion"" In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former President Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesnt make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cubas Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didnt realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government. A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. Representatives for USAID did not respond to a request for comment over the weekend. ADN Cubas founder also did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged. Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family. Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said. With or without U.S. funding, the sites are trying to reach readers like Jorge Norris, a 35-year-old IT engineer in Cuba, who uses a VPN to read sites such as Diario de Cuba and 14yMedio along with official Cuban media. ""Its another view to be able to form an idea of whats happening in the world,"" Norris said. ""You have to be completely informed of what they say here in Cuba and in the world.""",
"Rubio contests claim that US embargo is destabilizing Cuba, says only 'blockade' is its government",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-contests-claim-us-embargo-destabilizing-cuba-blockade-government,07/21/21,www.foxnews.com,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, turned back claims by Democrats who followed Black Lives Matter and blamed the decades-long U.S. embargo on Cuba for sparking the recent historic protests. Rubio spoke from the Senate floor Tuesday, where he contended that people who called the embargo cruel either ""don't know what they're talking about,"" or are ""liars."" ""There is only one blockage in Cuba and it is the blockage that the regime has imposed on its people,"" Rubio said. WASHINGTON DC REMOVES 'CUBA LIBRE STREET PAINTING FROM IN FRONT OF CUBAN EMBASSY Earlier this month, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets across the island nation to call for human rights and basic necessities. Black Lives Matter posted a statement last week that blamed the U.S. embargo for the country's instability and credited the Cuban government for historically granting ""Black revolutionaries"" asylum. SCALISE SLAMS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR SENDING 'DISGUSTING MESSAGE TO CUBANS Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., was silent on the issue until Thursday when she issued a statement expressing ""solidarity"" with the Cuban people. She also called for the end of the 60-year-old embargo which she claimed, in part, ""profoundly"" contributed to the suffering of Cubans. On Tuesday, Rubio also criticized the decision by the Biden administration to review remittances to Cuba to ensure that money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the regime taking a cut.

Reports: Cuba Sentencing Groups of Protesters in 'Summary Judgments',https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/21/reports-cuba-sentencing-up-30-protesters-time-summary-judgments/,07/21/21,www.breitbart.com,"The human rights advocacy group Cuban Prisoners Defenders revealed Wednesday that it had received evidence the Castro regime is putting protesters on trial in groups as large as 30 people at once without allowing them access to a lawyer or proper legal safeguards. Thousands of people across the island of Cuba took to the streets on July 11 demanding an end to communism, a nationwide outcry that followed years of active, consistent organization by the islands largest dissident groups. Protests continued throughout last week; organizers announced a nationwide march by the mothers of those arrested on July 11 to begin on Wednesday morning. Cuban State Security agents began intensive campaigns last week to arrest and disappear protesters. In some cases, eyewitnesses and video footage proved that uniformed police officers were resorting to door-to-door raids, beating suspected protesters and opening fire on them despite no evidence that they presented any threat. Early estimates suggested police arrested or otherwise disappeared 5,000 people, though international human rights groups have been able to confirm only about 600 such arrests. Those known to be in police custody have begun the process of being charged with ""crimes"" for actions like marching along with protests in silence or recording footage of police brutality. According to Cuban Prisoners Defenders, the Communist Party is denying most protesters the right to an attorney and police -- not prosecutors -- are in charge of the process. Without prosecutors, no formal indictment process exists. ""The summary 'trials, with no lawyers or possible defense, are happening simultaneously in numbers of ten accused at a time, and we have even had knowledge of cases of 30 accused [processed] simultaneously,"" the organization denounced. ""We are talking about hundreds of people being processed, if not thousands. Extremely grave."" Cuban Prisoners Defenders has previously condemned the Cuban regime repeatedly for refusing the right to an attorney to political prisoners. It noted in a report this weekend, based on preliminary discussions with sources on the ground there, that the accused often have no way of knowing what crime they are facing trial for until minutes before their sentencing. ""From the time that police initiate an 'investigation to the trial, the majority of cases last between 48 and 96 hours,"" the organization reported. Cuba Decide, a pro-democracy advocacy group working in the country, has identified 642 individuals who have been either arrested or remain missing since participating in the July 11 protests. Of these, 526 people remain in custody or disappeared, while the remaining have been released. Some of the released remain either on house arrest or under strict government surveillance. Advocacy groups have identified at least ten children among the arrested and disappeared. Most of the families of those identified, all of them in their teens, do not know the whereabouts of their children or accusations against them, Cuban independent outlets have reported. Reports indicate that the Castro regime is also disproportionately targeting religious leaders. Among the arrested are the leaders of the Free Yorubas Association of Cuba, a group that practices the Afro-Cuban religion of Lucumi, or Santeria, outside of the auspices of the atheist Communist Party. ""On July 19, 2021, the District Attorney of Placetas, Villa Clara, charged three members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, along with nine other individuals, with public disorder, disobedience, spreading the epidemic, and incitement,"" the Global Liberty Alliance, which advocates for the safety and freedom of those under religious persecution, denounced Tuesday. ""The Free Yorubas charged, Loreto Hernandez Garcia, Donaida Perez Paseiro and Elizabeth Cintra Garcia, will be held in a provisional prison as a precautionary measure until a trial is held."" ""These provisional prisons allegedly conduct re-education programs for political prisoners,"" the group added. Hernandez Garcias brother, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez ""Antunez,"" told the Miami Herald that several of those arrested are parents to minor children who police left abandoned at home after abducting their parents. Antunez himself served a 17-year term in prison in Cuba from 1990 to 2007 over his anti-communist activism; he now resides in Miami. ""They told my nephew that his parents were under arrest and awaiting trial,"" Antunez noted, adding that State Security officers are striving to break into homes and arrest people in the loudest, most terrifying way possible to scare neighbors out of considering participating in protests. Catholic leaders have also suffered persecution. The most high-profile case during the current wave of protests has been that of Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, arrested on July 11 after receiving a beating that left him with a bloody head injury. Police released Alvarez the next day after an unlawful detention. The clergyman explained in a subsequent interview that he was arrested after asking police for help to reach the hospital, once he realized police had beaten him to the point where he was bleeding profusely from the head. ""I went to help him [the injured protester], to take him out of that atmosphere ... they beat me on the head. I would have been able to keep helping, but once I saw myself bleeding so much I knew I needed to go to the hospital,"" he narrated. ""I got to the I got close to the police, the only ones with a car, and asked them to take me. ... Once they healed me, they detained me and I was taken to a police station.""

Poll: Most Voters Blame Communism for Cuba's Problems,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/21/poll-most-voters-blame-communism-cubas-problems/,07/21/21,www.breitbart.com,"While some leftists in the United States have slammed the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba following country-wide anti-government protests on the island, most Americans think communism is to blame for the Cubas problems, according to a Rasmussen poll released Wednesday. The survey asked likely U.S. voters ""which is more to blame for the current problems in Cuba, the policies of the communist government there or the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba?"" Fifty-nine percent of voters said the communist government is at fault. Only 20 percent blamed the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba while 21 percent were not sure. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in more than 40 municipalities last week demanding the end of Fidel Castros 62-year communist regime. Protesters were caught on camera yelling slogans like ""down with communism,"" ""they [the regime] must leave,"" and ""fuck Diaz-Canel!"" among other anti-government statements. Notably, protesters were seen cloaked in American flags, embracing the United States rather than condemning it for its alleged embargo. ""Voters who blame Communism for Cubas problems more than the U.S. economic embargo are most likely to have followed news about the protests in the Caribbean island nation,"" according to the poll report. Seventy-three percent of voters who blame communism for Cubas problems said they have followed news about the protests in Cuba very closely. Echoing the respondents paying close attention, Republicans were more likely to blame communism than Democrats were. Sixty-seven percent of Republicans, 49 percent of Democrats, and 61 percent of voters not affiliated with either major party said the policies of the communist government in Cuba are responsible for the islands ills. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blamed the ""absurdly cruel"" U.S. embargo of Cuba last week for the nations turmoil, mirroring a statement from Black Lives Matter (BLM). BLM praised Cubas communist regime while also condemning U.S. government sanctions and asserting Cubans have chosen their own government. When asked, ""should refugees from Cuba be allowed into the United States?"" 59 percent of Democrats said yes compared to 48 percent of Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Overall, 52 percent of voters said refugees from Cuba should be allowed into the United States, while just 28 percent said the U.S. shouldnt admit Cuban refugees. Twenty percent 20 percent were not sure. The Biden administration warned Cuban refugees that they will be turned away if they flee to the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also threatened to arrest, incarcerate, impose excessive fines, and even take the vessels of boaters who help U.S.-bound Cubans flee the repression and economic suffering at the hands of the island nations communist regime. Meanwhile, the Biden administration relaxed security at the U.S.-Mexico border -- ""revoking most of his predecessors measures -- which Republicans and other critics blame for the record surge of migrants reaching the United States from the south in recent months,"" Breitbart News reported. Now, most Cubans seeking to enter the U.S. have to sneak across the border or claim asylum once they reach an official port of entry like many other Latin Americans. Many Cubans in the United States have strongly identified with or leaned toward the Republican Party for decades. The survey of 1,000 U.S. Likely Voters was conducted on July 15 and 18, 2021. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95 percent level of confidence.",

Picture taken on July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, July 21 (Reuters) - An anti-government hip hop song by some of Cuba's most popular musicians in exile became the anthem of the unprecedented protests that rocked the Communist-run country last week. Now the visual artist who filmed the Cuban section of the videoclip for ""Patria y Vida"" ('Homeland and Life'), Anyelo Troya, 25, has been sentenced to a year in prison, according to relatives. He was charged with instigating unrest, they said, after attending a demonstration in Havana. Rights activists say this is just the start of what they predict will be a wave of summary trials of hundreds of people detained during and after the unusual protests on July 11 and 12 that the government has blamed on U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""They took him to trial without defense or lawyer or anything,"" Troya's mother Raisa Gonzalez told Reuters after witnessing his sentencing in what she called a collective trial of around a dozen people. The Cuban Foreign Ministry's International Press Center, which fields all requests from foreign journalists for comment from state entities, did not immediately reply to request for comment on the cases mentioned in this article. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday they had started the trials of those detained on charges of instigating unrest, committing vandalism, propagating the coronavirus pandemic, or assault, charges that could carry prison sentences of up to 20 years. ""There are people who will receive the response that Cuban legislation allows for, and it will be energetic,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on state television last week. He promised there would be due legislative procedure. But Gonzalez said she was not informed of her son's trial in time and when she arrived at the court with her lawyer, he had already been convicted. The trial was denounced by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) for taking place without proper defense or due process. Troya had already been under heightened vigilance for his participation in the song, whose headline is a twist on the revolutionary slogan 'Patria o Muerte' ('Homeland or Death'), his mother said. Javier Larrondo, a representative of the human rights organization Cuban Prisoners Defenders, said authorities would likely lock up the most charismatic and effective opposition leaders, who lately have often been young artists, whether or not they were at the protests. ""We will have hundreds of political prisoners in just two weeks,"" he said. The protests against Cuba's worst economic crisis in decades and curbs on civil liberties first erupted ten days ago in a small town before spreading throughout the country. By the evening of day two, they appeared to have dissipated amid heavy security operations and internet disruptions. The government blamed mercenaries exploiting frustrations with hardships caused by U.S. sanctions. Exiled rights group Cubalex, which has established a spreadsheet of those detained that it updates every day as new reports come in, says more than 500 Cubans appear to have been detained during the protests or afterwards. It said the tally was likely higher, but some families may fear reporting the arrest of relatives in case of reprisals such as losing their state sector jobs. Some of those detained, like theater director Yunior Garcia, have been released to house arrest. ""I have four officials in front of my door preventing me going out,"" Garcia told Reuters, which observed the officials. ""When I go to buy food or cigarettes, one of them goes with me to keep a close eye on me."" #SOS CUBA The majority of those detained have been kept incommunicado, while the location of some is still unknown, said Cubalex and HRW, based on interviews with relatives. Cubans have been posting photos of people they say they cannot locate or sharing stories of detentions on a Facebook group called 'Disappeared #SOSCuba' with more than 10,000 members. ""We went from police station to police station looking for her,"" said Alberto Betancourt of his sister, a stay-at-home mother-of-two who was detained at a protest in Havana. He located her after six days. ""They won't let me speak to her,"" he told Reuters, holding back tears. ""But she's not a criminal. She just let herself be swept up in the crowds."" Cuban interior ministry officials denied on Tuesday that anyone was missing and said a list of detainees circulating - they did not specify which - was manipulated and included people who were never detained. The detained include high profile dissidents like Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who also featured in ""Patria y Vida,"" and Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the country's largest opposition group. They also include ordinary citizens and bystanders, families and rights groups say. Many of those detained had been beaten or mistreated by security forces or rapid-reaction brigades - government-organized bands of civilian recruits, said HRW senior researcher Juan Pappier. Used to quiet streets, Cubans have been shocked over the last week by images of violence that have emerged on social media: security forces and bands of stick-wielding people in civilian garb beating protesters, as well as protesters throwing stones at police and overturning police cars. Diaz-Canel said last week ""maybe there will be a need for apologies to anyone who, in the middle of all the confusion, has been mistreated,"" and defended security forces' actions to re-establish ""peace.""

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - Katiuska Mustelier Sosa says her brother joined the protests in Cuba on July 11 and shares video of when he was last seen. Because she hasnt seen or heard from him, she fears he was seriously beaten. Enrique Mustelier Sosa, 38, a self-proclaimed member of the opposition, was detained that day in the city of Guantanamo.

""That the president hear from a diverse set of voices,"" she said. Meanwhile, Sen.

The man, who did not give his name, spoke through ""Freedom""-embossed duct tape. ""These chains represent the dictatorship in Cuba. This blood represents the blood that is going to be on the hands of those who stand next to the dictatorship - and not next to the Cuban people,"" he said.

The man said the United States must stand with the civilians of Cuba and not with Miguel Diaz-Canel's autocratic rule, which he has held since younger Castro brother Raul, 90, ceded power to him in 2018. A woman standing next to the man in similar attire reiterated his call: ""The only vaccine the Cuban people need is freedom - please help!"" Host Sean Hannity turned to a delegation of Florida lawmakers standing beside him, and asked what they have heard or asked of the Biden White House in this regard. Rep.

""We are very frustrated, we are very upset: because we have called respectfully and told Biden administration that this has nothing to do with political parties. He will not meet,"" she said. Salazar's seat is notable in that regard, as hers is one of few Democrat-majority districts that flipped Republican in 2020 - when the longtime news anchor defeated former Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who like Salazar is of Cuban ancestry, said that the world cannot forget the plight of the Cuban people, and that the activism in support of them ""cannot stop until Cuba is free and has liberty.""

The Versailles corner has been a rallying point for the Cuban-American community for decades, as it is also where celebrations popped up in 2016, as demonstrators celebrated dictator Fidel Castro's death.

(AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba criticized the United States and President Joe Biden on Wednesday for a series of statements by senior officials after the unprecedented protests on the island last week, accusing the U.S. government of seeking to justify a military intervention. Johana Tablada, deputy director for U.S. affairs at Cubas Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said U.S. officials are painting a false picture of the situation in Cuba, which is struggling with severe economic problems amid a surge in coronavirus infections. ""There is a Walt Disney narrative of a bad government and people fighting for their freedom -- stereotypes that scare anyone who has never set foot in Cuba, because of their arrogance and disregard for the truth,"" Tablada said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They are very interested in fabricating an alternative reality because the riots of July 11 werent enough to justify the war that is being waged on us,"" she added. ADVERTISEMENT Communicating via social networks, thousands of Cubans took to the streets July 11 in various parts of the country to voice complaints over power cuts, long lines at stores, shortages of goods and rising prices, while some called for changes in the government. The protests ended in acts of vandalism, destruction of patrol cars, stone throwing at hospitals and looting. There were also violent arrests of protesters by the police, witnessed by AP, and according to authorities one death. Officials have not released a list of prisoners, but Human Rights Watch said in a reported Wednesday that about 500 had been arrested. The day before, Col. Victor Alvarez at the Ministry of the Interior said that some detainees had been released when there wasnt enough evidence to prove they participated in protests, but others were being processed by the judicial system. He did not give any numbers or other details. The protests were the largest in more than two decades, while groups of government supporters also took to the streets, including tens of thousands on Saturday. Authorities suspended cellphone internet data service on the island, charging that a campaign orchestrated from the United States used robot messaging on Twitter and other social media to instigate the demonstrations. Officials also insisted that U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration are responsible for the islands shortages of food, medicine and fuel. A petition on the Change.org platform created by a citizen in Belgium asking for the U.S. government to invade Cuba has been signed by almost 500,000 people, and some Florida politicians have raised such an action as a possibility. Tablada said that while there are no current U.S. military movements aimed at Cuba, there are signs of extreme aggressiveness, such as those that led to an interventions in Libya and Iraq. ADVERTISEMENT ""We are at a time when discourse has deteriorated to unprecedented levels,"" she said. ""From the Biden government in regards to Cuba, we have seen parading several times a day, every day since July 11, senior United States officials saying things that are not true"" about Cuba. Biden promised during his election campaign that he would resume President Barack Obamas policy of rapprochement with the island, but after entering the White House, he kept in place all the toughened sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump, including adding Cubas government to a list of sponsors of terrorism. The White House has said a working group has been told to review the U.S. policy blocking Cuban Americans from sending money to Cuba but to ensure that the Cuban government does not serve as intermediary in the flow of cash. Washington says it is also considering increasing the staff at its embassy in Havana to facilitate the participation of civil society.

The governor repeated his insistence that the White House help provide internet access on the island after the Cuban government shut down social media sites at the height of the protests. ""The internet access is something we have the capability of doing. We have companies in the US that want to do it, but they need the OK of the federal government,"" DeSantis said.

Last week, Biden described Cuba as a ""failed state"" and communism as a ""universally failed system"" and added that his administration was ""considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate"" internet access on the island.

"US sanctions Cuba for repressing protests, Biden warns more to come",https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-sanctions-cuba-for-repressing-protests-biden-warns-more-to-come/,07/22/21,www.breitbart.com,"The United States imposed sanctions on Cubas defense minister and a special forces unit Thursday for repressing peaceful protests, a step President Joe Biden warned is ""just the beginning"" of punitive measures against Havana. The US Treasury Department said its Office of Foreign Assets Control froze the assets of minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Special National Brigade (SNB), a division of Cubas interior ministry, in relation to human rights abuses committed during a crackdown on protests on the island earlier in July. ""This is just the beginning -- the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said in a statement. The sanctions were imposed under the Magnitsky act, which allows a US president to take action against human rights abuses and corruption. Biden said his administration targeted Lopez Miera and the SNB -- a special forces unit nicknamed the Black Berets -- because they were ""driving the crackdown"" against protesters who took to the streets by the thousands in rare public demonstrations against the communist government. ""As we hold the Cuban regime accountable, our support for the Cuban people is unwavering,"" Biden said. The president also condemned what he called ""the mass detentions and sham trials"" used to imprison and silence outspoken Cubans. Cuba pushed back swiftly, calling the sanctions ""slanderous"" and saying the United States should focus more on repression and police brutality on its own soil. ""I reject unfounded and slanderous sanctions by the US government"" against the Cubans targeted, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter. The sanctions freeze all Lopez Miera and SNB assets and interests in the United States, as well as prohibit any US citizen, resident or entity from engaging with them financially. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Biden, for his part, said Washington was considering multiple new steps. The United States is working closely with regional partners like the Organization of American States ""to pressure the regime to immediately release wrongfully detained political prisoners, restore internet access and allow the Cuban people to enjoy their fundamental rights,"" he said. Washington is also reassessing its policy guiding remittances to Cuba, with the State Department expressing concern that such funds could ""find their way into Cuban government coffers,"" according to spokesman Ned Price. Washington will ""continue to review what more we can do"" to support the Cuban people while holding the nations authorities to account, Price said. 'Weak response On July 11 and 12, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in 40 cities shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Down with the dictatorship,"" and ""Were hungry."" One person has died and more than 100 have been arrested since the protests broke out over the worst economic crisis in decades. According to the Treasury Department, Cubas defense ministry and security services attacked people and ""arrested or disappeared over 100 protesters in an attempt to suppress these protests."" The demonstrations have further strained an already tense relationship between Washington and Havana. Cuba has seen a whiplash in US policy in recent years, with former president Barack Obama normalizing relations at the end of his term, declaring that a half-century of efforts to topple the regime had failed, and then his successor Donald Trump reimposing sweeping economic pressure. Biden as president had exhibited a go-slow approach to Cuba, but the unrest has thrust the relationship into a spotlight. Several US lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, applauded the administrations sanctions. For some Republicans it was not enough. Senator Roger Wicker tweeted on Thursday he was ""disappointed in the weak response from (Biden) and @StateDept as the Cuban people cry out for help.""",

""The United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" he said. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, in a message on Twitter, rejected the sanctions as ""unfounded and slanderous"" and urged the United States to apply such measures to its own record of ""daily repression and policy brutality."" The Treasury Department said the sanctions had been placed on an entire Interior Ministry security unit and on General Alvaro Lopez Miera, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, describing him as leader of an entity ""whose members have engaged in serious human rights abuse."" Thousands of Cubans staged protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has brought shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Hundreds of activists were detained. Biden had promised during the 2020 campaign to reverse some of Trump's Cuba policies, but Thursday's announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement. At the same time, the administration is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people. The White House said on Tuesday that Biden would form a working group to examine remittances to Cuba in the wake of the protests. The aim is to determine how Cuban-Americans can send money to families on the island while keeping the funds out of the hands of the Cuban government. A Cuban flag hangs over a street in downtown Havana, Cuba, July 15, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Trump had imposed tight restrictions on remittances, which are believed to have previously amounted to several billions of dollars annually. The White House, in a statement, cautioned that the remittances issue was complex and ""requires a measured and thoughtful approach in coordination with experts."" Biden reiterated on Thursday that his administration is looking for ways to help ordinary Cubans regain internet access after Havana restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook (FB.O) and WhatsApp. ""We will work closely with our partners throughout the region, including the Organization of American States, to pressure the regime,"" Biden said. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. GLOBAL MAGNITSKY SANCTIONS The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, used to punish human rights violators with U.S. asset freezes and bans on travel to the United States. But U.S. officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have U.S. financial dealings and seldom travel to the United States, limiting the practical impact of such measures. The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency into Biden's broad Cuba policy review, which began shortly after he took office in January. Until now, Cuba had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad. Cuba, a State Department official told Reuters, is now a ""top priority."" Analysts say conciliatory moves are unlikely in the near term. Complicating matters was Biden's poorer-than-expected showing with voters in south Floridas anti-communist Cuban-American community, which backed Trumps tough policies toward Havana and Caracas and helped him win the battleground state. Many analysts say Biden may have to tread carefully on Cuba policy ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.

President Joe Biden said in a statement that Thursday's actions were ""just the beginning--the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people."" ""I unequivocally condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence,"" he said.

McCarthy huddles with GOP to push Biden on Cuba strategy amid historic protests,https://nypost.com/2021/07/22/mccarthy-huddles-with-gop-to-push-biden-on-cuba-strategy/,07/22/21,nypost.com,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy huddled with members of the House GOPs 16-member Cuba advisory group Wednesday to discuss policy options to aid Cuban protesters pushing back against the Communist regime to hold it accountable. The group is weighing its legislative options, with members asserting they are looking to work across the aisle and with the Biden administration to ramp up pressure on Cuba to allow for peaceful protesting in the face of violence and repression from Cuban officials. Following the advisory groups first meeting, McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he plans to hold meetings in Miami, where members can hear from experts and people impacted by the human rights abuses. ""Weve got a lot of different ones that we were going to move forward on. First thing were going to do, too, is, you know, we sent a letter to all the ambassadors, weve got a letter to the president, [on] actions that we think need to take place,"" McCarthy told The Post. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy huddles with GOP lawmakers to discuss Cuba. Caleb Smith ""We want to make sure to invite Democrats to join us, were going to do a complete conference policy meeting next week to educate everybody the places [were] going, and were talking about putting a meeting together down in Miami."" Some of the islands largest protests in recent history have emerged in the wake of food, medicine, electricity and internet shortages. And lawmakers in the group have vowed to do all in their power to help secure freedom in the country. McCarthy announced earlier this month he tapped GOP Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Salazar of Florida, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, Puerto Rico Delegate Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes and Ken Calvert of California, Mark Green of Tennessee, Hal Rogers of Kentucky, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Chris Smith of New Jersey, House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul and House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Kay Granger of Texas, and Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington to serve on the panel, which was formed shortly after the demonstrations began to heat up.

Ron DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio for a town hall on Fox News ""Hannity"" Wednesday night to call on the Biden administration to do more to help the Cuban people following protests against Havanas Communist regime last week. She and Rubio accused Biden of refusing to meet with them to discuss next steps. ""Were very frustrated. We are very upset, because we have called respectfully and we have told the Biden administration this has nothing to do with political parties,"" Salazar, whose district includes Miamis Little Havana, told host Sean Hannity. ""He will not meet with us."" ""Weve asked for meetings,"" Rubio concurred. ""It hasnt happened so far."" Malliotakis said she is encouraged by the Biden administrations talk of new sanctions, but feels it needs to be acting more swiftly to aid in securing the internet on the island so its people can communicate and get their message out. ""Were coming up with action items that we think that the Biden administration should be taking to try to advance the cause of the Cuban people who want freedom. We are disappointed with the response from the Biden administration thus far,"" she said. The New York Republican, who was briefed by the State Department along with a handful of other members, said she was encouraged the administration indicated it would not lift the embargo, arguing lifting it would ""only further prop up the regime that is weakened right now."" She added that there are existing bipartisan measures she would like to see move in the House.

And the second thing is to really push democracies, freedom-loving countries from around the world to join and to push in a united effort to rid the island of this illegitimate regime and bring freedom and democracy to the island,"" she continued. ""We have a number of bipartisan resolutions. I have introduced a bipartisan resolution, also [Rep. Debbie] Wasserman [Schultz (D-Fla.)] has introduced a resolution and so far it has not come up for a vote and were hoping that its going to come to the Foreign Affairs Committee for a vote,"" she said. ""It shouldnt be hard to stand on the side of freedom and to condemn a brutal, murderous regime."" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) said she is encouraged by the Biden administrations talk of new sanctions. Getty Images A number of progressives including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- both socialists -- have slammed the embargo, with Sanders tweeting that it has ""only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."" But GOP lawmakers blasted their argument, asserting that the Cuban regime controls how much money and what resources are made available to its citizens. ""When you hear Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and others talk about lifting the embargo, they [Cuba] do business with nearly every other country in the world and nothing gets to the people, any of the money, any of the medicine,"" Malliotakis said. Green echoed her calls for the embargo to remain intact. ""Well, we obviously have to keep the embargo in place, I mean 90 percent of the economy in Cuba is run by military holding companies. So, any lifting of the embargo just empowers the regime more,"" he said. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has slammed the embargo. Getty Images Green said one option they could move forward with is a resolution calling for the people of Cuba to be allowed to have a First Amendment. One potential avenue lawmakers have weighed advocating is pushing for the creation of a back channel to be able to communicate with allies in Cuba in a similar fashion to the system the Trump administration pursued with allies in Iran. McCaul, who has been vocal in pushing back against the Cuban regime, stressed the importance of ensuring internet access is available to allow Cubans to fight for their freedoms, noting legislation he and Sen. Masha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have worked on in an attempt to ensure access to open communication is available. ""The Open Technology Fund, which Senator Blackburn and I authorized, has helped to fund technology that is currently circumventing Chinese-supported censorship in Cuba,"" he said. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) stressed the importance of ensuring internet access is available to allow Cubans to fight for their freedoms. Getty Images ""Our estimates are nearly 1.3 million Cubans have access to the internet because of initiatives supported by the Open Technology Fund. We need more tools like the Open Technology Fund to support people around the world who are fighting for their freedom, like the people in Cuba."" Gimenez said helping seek technological solutions is a key component in aiding Cuban protesters in being able to protect themselves from violence and add transparency to the situation on a broader platform. ""We want the people of Cuba to be able to communicate with themselves, and also with the outside world. We think that thats a very, thats really a very important aspect of this, because this was all organic,"" he said. ""So we think that the Cubans, what they did is they tried to shut that down, and they have. So if we re-establish it, then organically the Cubans can again start to organize, and then also can protect themselves somewhat from the brutality of the regime by videoing, and then also sending those signals."" Biden called for the State Department to establish a working group on Monday that would be tasked with examining remittances in an attempt to ensure money being sent to relatives in Cuba is received by the proper individuals and not seized by the regime.",
Biden sanctions Cuban official over protest crackdown,https://nypost.com/2021/07/22/biden-to-sanction-cuba-officials-over-protest-crackdown-report/,07/22/21,nypost.com,"President Biden has authorized US sanctions against one Cuban official and a Cuban government agency in the wake of a crackdown on antigovernment protests.

Biden said in a statement that ""my Administration is imposing new sanctions targeting elements of the Cuban regime responsible for this crackdown -- the head of the Cuban military and the division of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior driving the crackdown -- to hold them accountable for their actions."" ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said. But the sanctions against the Black Berets arent new, the Treasury Department noted in a press release. Former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against the entire Cuban Interior Ministry, including the brigade, in January, and it does not appear that those sanctions were lifted by Biden. It was not immediately clear why Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who called the protesters ""counter-revolutionary mercenaries"" and oversaw the crackdown, is not facing sanctions.

Critics have called on Biden to act amid the crackdown this month on protesters, who condemned communist leaders while protesting food shortages and a lack of COVID-19 vaccines. Although US sanctions can be a major inconvenience by freezing the use of bank accounts, credit cards and other financial services, Cuba is largely detached from the international financial system -- with salaries averaging $44 per month -- and its unclear what practical effect the new sanctions will have on Lopez Miera and the Black Berets. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (second from left) promised he would ""battle in the streets"" to stop protesters.

YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images Biden said last week that the US is investigating whether its technically possible to override an internet blackout imposed by communist authorities on the island. The lack of internet access prevents distribution of information on protests. Former President Donald Trump was able to boost support for Republicans among Latinos last year by claiming that Democratic policies could turn the US into a larger version of Cuba or Venezuela. Biden last week denounced communism -- and said socialism wasnt much better, despite an increasing number of Democrats who self-identify as socialists -- when he was asked by a reporter to respond to the Cuba protests. But Republicans called on him to do more to support the activists in Cuba. ""As it stands now, hes basically just sitting there doing nothing,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) said this week. ""Hes leaving these folks out to dry, and whats gonna end up happening, if they dont get any type of assistance, is the regime will continue to clamp down, and theyll eventually stamp this out and then theyll remain even stronger in power, and that will be a huge blow to the cause of freedom.""",

US sanctions Cuba over crackdown on protests in 1st steps toward new policy,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-sanctions-cuba-crackdown-protests-1st-steps-policy/story?id=78993718,07/22/21,abcnews.go.com,"In his first steps toward his own Cuba policy, President Joe Biden is sanctioning the Cuban defense minister and its special forces for the aggressive crackdowns on protests across the island nation earlier this month, the White House announced Thursday. Those protests were some of the largest and most widespread in decades as Cuba reels from a new wave of the coronavirus, the economic pain of COVID-19, and shortages of food and medicine. They also short-circuited Biden's administration into a response. Six months into his term, Biden has yet to formulate a policy toward America's close neighbor after his former boss Barack Obama warmed relations with Cuba's communist government and his immediate predecessor Donald Trump all but cut contact and implemented the toughest sanctions and restrictions. ""This is just the beginning - the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" Biden said in a statement Thursday, demanding the government ""immediately release wrongfully detained political prisoners, restore internet access, and allow the Cuban people to enjoy their fundamental rights."" The Treasury Department announced that it sanctioned Defense Minister Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Brigada Especial Nacional, the government's special forces unit within the Interior Ministry that was deployed ""to suppress and attack protesters,"" according to the agency. The new sanctions are not likely to inflict any new pain in Havana beyond the decades-old embargo, but they send a clearer message about where Biden will stand after Obama's rapprochement and Trump's heavy penalties. The Cuban Foreign Ministry has not yet responded, but government leaders including President Miguel Diaz-Canel repeatedly blamed the U.S. government or the Cuban diaspora in Miami for stirring up the protests. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. While he helped Obama's efforts to ease tensions with Cuba and reopen trade and travel, Biden has kept most of Trump's sanctions and restrictions in place so far as his administration completes his review. Beyond Thursday's sanctions, the administration announced other baby steps in staking out its own Cuba policy earlier this week, including creating a working group to study the issue of remittances -- the money that Americans, especially Cuban Americans, send back to the island. Remittances were severely restricted by the Trump administration, which said they were largely lining the pockets of the Cuban government as it charged large fees for their transmission. The limits imposed by Trump led Western Union, the financial services company, to close its operations in Cuba. Biden's new working group will look for ways to allow money to flow to the Cuban people without enriching the Cuban government, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. Biden had said last week that he would not ease those Trump-era restrictions, but administration officials denied they were backing away from that pledge, noting that the president said during a press conference that it was ""highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances or a big chunk of it."" ""Thats certainly something that we're mindful of and we're looking at. That will be a point of discussion in these working groups,"" Psaki said Tuesday. State Department spokesperson Ned Price added that there's no amount of Cuban government collection on remittances that would be ""acceptable to us"" but declined to get ahead of what the working group may decide. He also announced that the State Department will launch its own review about adding staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana. Only a skeleton crew works there now after Trump's first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson drew down embassy staff after the first reports of medical incidents sometimes known as ""Havana syndrome"" emerged publicly. ""The staffing at our embassy will serve to enhance our diplomatic, our engagement - our diplomatic activity, our engagement with civil society, our consular service engagement, all of which will be in service of helping the Cuban people to secure greater degrees of human rights, of freedom, of the universal rights that have been denied to them for far too long,"" Price said Tuesday. He declined to provide any timeline on when staffing changes could be made or speak to any changes in security after those ""unexplained health incidents,"" as the department calls them, that cause ""Havana syndrome"" -- except to say safety will be a top consideration in this review.",
New U.S. sanctions aim to punish Cuban forces for crackdowns on protesters.,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/us/politics/sanctions-cuba-protesters.html,07/22/21,www.nytimes.com,"WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration issued new sanctions on Thursday against Cubas defense minister and an elite brigade of government security forces over human rights violations during a crackdown on protesters this month. In the days since demonstrations erupted across Cuba on July 11, the Biden administration has been consulting with officials in Washington and experts on how broadly it should impose economic penalties against authorities accused of ordering or carrying out a heavy-handed response. The Biden administration concluded that Alvaro Lopez Miera, the head of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, ""has played an integral role in the repression of ongoing protests in Cuba,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement. Members of the special forces unit Boinas Negras, or Black Berets, which was previously placed under sanctions during the final days of the Trump administration, will also be penalized for a wave of arrests larger than any other crackdown in years, if not decades.",
US sanctions Cuban security chief and special forces over crackdown on protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/22/us-cuba-sanctions-protests-human-rights,07/22/21,www.theguardian.com,"The US has imposed sanctions on a Cuban security minister and an interior ministry special forces unit for alleged human rights abuses in a crackdown on anti-government protests this month. The move marked the first concrete steps by Joe Bidens administration to apply pressure on Cubas Communist government as it faces calls from US lawmakers and the Cuban American community to show greater support for the biggest protests to hit the island in decades. The speed with which the administration has crafted new sanctions further signals Biden is highly unlikely to soften the US approach to Cuba any time soon after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era detente with Havana. ""This is just the beginning,"" Biden said in a statement, expressing condemnation for ""mass detentions and sham trials"". ""The United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people,"" he said. The Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, in a message on Twitter, rejected the sanctions as ""unfounded and slanderous"" and urged the US to apply such measures to its own record of ""systematic repression and police brutality"". The treasury department said the sanctions had been placed on an entire interior ministry security unit and on Gen Alvaro Lopez Miera, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, describing him as leader of an entity ""whose members have engaged in serious human rights abuse"". Thousands of Cubans staged protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has brought shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Hundreds of activists were detained. Biden had promised during the 2020 campaign to reverse some of Trumps Cuba policies, but Thursdays announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement. At the same time, the administration says it is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people. The White House said on Tuesday that Biden would form a working group to examine remittances to Cuba in the wake of the protests. The aim is to determine how Cuban Americans can send money to families on the island while keeping the funds out of the hands of the Cuban government. Trump had imposed tight restrictions on remittances, which are believed to have previously amounted to several billions of dollars annually. The White House, in a statement, cautioned that the remittances issue was complex and ""requires a measured and thoughtful approach in coordination with experts"". Biden reiterated on Thursday that his administration was looking for ways to help ordinary Cubans regain internet access after Havana restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp. ""We will work closely with our partners throughout the region, including the Organization of American States, to pressure the regime,"" Biden said. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls US-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions. The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, used to punish human rights violators with US asset freezes and bans on travel to the US. But US officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have US financial dealings and seldom travel to the US, limiting the practical impact of such measures. The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency into Bidens broad Cuba policy review, which began shortly after he took office in January. Until now, Cuba had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad.",

According to Cubalex, a human rights organization that has been monitoring the detentions, more than 600 Cubans across the island were detained following the protests that sparked July 11. Local human rights attorneys have started filing complaints with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. But Cuba will likely not cooperate with such investigations or allow them on the island.

Trials Begin for Cuba Protesters without Defense Attorneys,https://havanatimes.org/features/trials-begin-for-cuba-protesters-without-defense-attorneys/,07/22/21,havanatimes.org,"Anyelo Troya (l) was sentenced to a year in prison for ""disorderly conduct"" after taking pictures of the July 11 protests. Photo: Diario de Cuba By El Toque HAVANA TIMES - ""Summary"" proceedings to sentence participants in the July 11th protests for crimes of inciting public disorder and crimes have started in Cuba, and defendants are being refused their right to have a defense attorney present. The news emerged after the case of Anyelo Troya Gonzalez went public, a Cuban visual artist and photographer who directed and recorded the music video for ""Patria y Vida"" in Cuba, alongside Maykel Osorbo, El Funky and Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, in early 2021. On July 11th, Anyelo was arrested when taking photos of the protests in Havana and was taken down to the police station at 100th and Aldabo streets, in the capital. On July 20th, news got out that Troya Gonzalez had been subjected to a summary proceeding, without a lawyer present to defend him. His mother, Raisa Gonzalez Cantillo, reported that she had gone to the station at 100th and Aldabo streets in the morning that day, with a defense attorney, and when they got there, they were informed that the photographer had been transferred to the Court in 10 de Octubre for a summary proceeding. By the time they reached the Court, the proceeding had come to an end, with no notice given to the family beforehand and without the defense attorneys participation, whom they had hired for this end. On July 21st, Troya Gonzalez and the other 10 detainees were notified of the Courts ruling. The visual artist was sentenced to one year in prison for ""public disorder"", Gonzalez Cantillo told Reuters news agency. Out of the 11 people taken to court for their hearing, only two were able to have a lawyer present. This isnt an isolated case. The Cuban government has decided to process hundreds of peaceful protestors with summary proceedings, a process that allows sentences to be ruled in less than 20 days for people who have been accused of crimes that do not exceed the sanction of one year in prison. These express hearings against those arrested on 11J and afterwards is a mechanism that they have decided to make even harder with a lack of transparency in the way information of every individual case is handled. More and more relatives of detainees are coming forward with testimonies, like in Anyelos case, and Ministry of Interior officials purposely mislead them, misinforming or denying access to data - such as the number of the case files, dates and locations of the hearings. While the Governments official version of events states that nobody was missing, and that proceedings follow due diligence, the reality is that hundreds of people havent been located within the timeframe stipulated by the Law, nor have their whereabouts or the charges against them been revealed. The proof? Citizens initiatives have managed to draw up a list of at least 587 people who were arrested during the 11J protests and in the days following. Initiatives put the spotlight on the hundreds of detainees & their families Cuban civil society has articulated many different initiatives to follow, help and give visibility to the situation of hundreds of detainees and their families after the 11J protests. In order to give detainees less protection, authorities are pressuring and hindering motions filed by lawyers belonging to the National Organization of Collective Law Firms (ONBC), the only institution through which a lawyer can represent citizens in legal procedures. ELTOQUE Juridico has been able to confirm pressure and threats to lawyers in Havana, Cienfuegos and Villa Clara, to stop them from representing people who have been charged for taking part in the protests; so, they can take them to secret trial without legal representation. A source from a collective law firm in Playa municipality, in the capital, revealed that once a relative applies for representation for a detainee, they have to receive authorization from the ONBC Provincial Board and this entity has to then receive authorization from the National Board, providing the detainees information and charges, so that the decision about whether a lawyer can or cannot defend the detainee is made at that level. So much bureaucracy just to slow down and drag out the appointment of a defense attorney in proceedings where the defenses reaction time is key. Its very likely that the trial is already underway or has finished by the time a lawyer has been appointed, such as in Anyelo Troyas case. Summary proceedings in Cuban legislation In their effort to discredit the peaceful protests, Cuban authorities are charging detainees with the crimes of public disorder and incitement of a riot. In their most basic form, both of these can be taken to trial with a summary proceeding under Cuban law. Summary proceedings are contemplated as ""jurisdiction without action"" trials in Cuban legal theory. These are trials where neither a district attorney or lawyer has to be present. Summary hearings are a total disadvantage for detainees, especially when they are being taken to trial for exercising a constitutional right, because they are kept silent. Not in the sense that they are unable to speak, but because holding the summary hearing without specialist expertise or the legal assistance of a professional, limits their chances of articulating an argument that places all of the focus on the illegitimacy of the trial. Summary proceedings attack one of the basic safeguards of due diligence: the right to a defense. Defense is a universal right, which in the case of proceedings against the 11J protestors, can be restricted on two fronts. During a summary proceeding, a lawyer cannot be hired until the date and time of the hearing has been established. Keeping this date - which is worked out between the Court and the Ministry of Interior - secret right up until the last moment, makes it harder for detainees or their families (if the former are being detained) from hiring a lawyer. Testimonies from family members confirm that this really is another one of the Cuban governments repressive tactics used today. Even if relatives are able to hire a lawyer in advance, it doesnt stop a trial from going ahead. The lawyer must be present at the time the trial session begins in Court, because thats when the judge must be informed that the lawyer will be representing the defendant. If the lawyer doesnt make it in time to the hearing, their contract means nothing. A summary proceeding was used to sentence rap singer Denis Solis in November 2020. Solis was sentenced to eight months in jail, within 72 hours of being arrested. One of the main arguments of those advocating for his release was that he was kept hidden away and was denied the chance to have a lawyer present at the trial against him. This is a fact that very few people mention today. Denis Solis: a story of contempt and forced disappearances in Havana Despite contempt being considered a crime in Cuba, a great deal of international Law and some of the most important international human rights organizations classify it as incompatible with freedom of speech. This crime was used to send a young critic of the Cuban government to jail. Nevertheless, days later, Cuban legal authorities recognized that the entire proceeding against the rapper and San Isidro Movement member had been legal, via a judicial decree in which they rejected a habeas corpus presented in his favor. One of the arguments the judges used to determine the trials legitimacy was the fact that the day after his arrest, the Police had notified Denis Solis himself about the possibility of ""naming a lawyer and presenting evidence at trial"". That said, what good is it if they comply with the formality of notifying the detainee about the date of his trial and his ability to name a lawyer, if they then cut him off from the world? Does this formality make any sense when it isnt offering a safeguard, because family and friends arent being informed about the accuseds situation? Repression with violence is now ""legal"" On July 20, 2021, the Cuban governments strategy to legitimize repression began to materialize, which brutally unfolded on 11J. With ""riots"" (as the Cuban Ambassador called them) calmed down, the only thing left to do is to take everyone who took to the streets to shout ""homeland and life"" or incited others to stand with them in this action of being fed up, to court. The protests were the concrete expression of their dissatisfaction and unhappiness. Part of the governments strategy is to subject hundreds of detainees to express trials. Trials that will be held amidst chaos: hundreds of relatives going to detention centers and a society exposed to opposing narratives -official versions of transparency and respect for legal proceedings-, and concrete actions to hold the accused incommunicado at police stations. Such makes it easier for arbitrary and politically-motivated trials to go ahead, without warning. The Cuban government has outlined what could be understood as a bidirectional strategy that legalizes, from a legal standpoint, the detention and repression of arrested protestors during and after 11J. The hundreds of detainees will be separated into protestors connected to acts of ""vandalism"" and ""violence"" and protestors who peacefully took to the streets to exercise their legal right to protest. This division is only a methodological and procedural, because in the hearts of those who hold power in Cuba - and felt the real power of the people like never before - its just as much a crime to loot a store as it is to shout ""homeland and life"" on a public street. Mostly from underprivileged and neglected groups in Cuban society, the ""violent vandals"" will not be taken to trial immediately. The serious crimes they are being charged with - can result in a 20-year jail sentence - and mean that the investigation can be extended to 60-180 days. During this time, they will remain in a provisional prison facility awaiting their trial. Colonel Moraima Bravet announced this on the TV show Hacemos Cuba, on July 14, 2021. The head of Criminal Investigations at the Ministry of Interior (MININT) stated that they had received the indication from above to be strict. The MININT and the Attorney Generals Office together hold all of the power to determine how long a criminal investigation will go on for and when a detainee can or cannot await trial at home. That said, the other group of Cubans who were arrested for taking to the streets and expressing themselves, for recording these expressions and, last but not least, exercising a right that doesnt exist according to the Government, will be taken to trial with an express hearing. They will be taken to trial just like Anyelo Troya and another 10 Cubans were on July 20, 2021. They will be taken to trial just like 17-year-old Amanda Hernandez Celaya will be on July 22nd, for recording the protests and repression with her cellphone.

Pompeo Explains How Trump Would Have Handled Cuba Better,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/22/exclusive-pompeo-explains-how-he-and-trump-would-have-handled-cuba-better-than-biden/,07/22/21,www.breitbart.com,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Breitbart News exclusively that he and former President Donald Trump would have been much more forceful and aggressive with the Communist regime in Cuba in response to protests there as people rise up against the oppressive government, pushing for more freedom. ""There would have been three things that would have been different at the outset, probably a longer list,"" Pompeo said when asked how he and Trump would have handled things differently from Biden. ""First, it would have taken all of three seconds--and Im not even sure my team would have had to get my approval--to put out a statement that 'We support the people of Cuba and their freedom. Communism has destroyed their lives and they want out from that yolk--God bless you and please make sure youre doing everything you can to deliver an outcome, change the regime so you can live out that freedom. Literally, my team would have known it was on our hearts and who we were--it wouldnt have taken us 48 seconds let alone 48 hours to do that. Second, we put enormous pressure on the Cuban regime and I think that emboldened the Cuban people. The Cuban regime is at its weakest point in history, giving the chance for the Cuban people to rise up. We would have enforced that with everything we did in the aftermath of these uprisings. Finally, there were some real tactical things we would have begun to do. When you have one element within the government that has all the guns, its very hard for these protesters--they put their lives at risk. We would have made sure at the very least they had the ability to communicate with each other all across that island. Its only 90 miles away. The ability for them to communicate is invaluable. They can talk about where the protests are, they can talk about where the Cuban government is, and then finally we would have warned the Russians too: 'Dont you dare step in here, dont you dare come 90 miles from our shore and support this Cuban regime. We would have drawn a big line there and given the Cuban people the courage there to continue their protests and demand their freedom."" Pompeo also noted that unlike under Democrat John F. Kennedys presidency, which saw the Cuban Missile Crisis, Democrats nowadays under Democrat President Joe Bidens administration and former Democrat President Barack Obamas administration sought to appease the Communist regime 90 miles south of Miami. ""It shifted,"" Pompeo said when asked what changed among Democrats. ""President Obama wanted to go to a baseball game there and, I dont know, look cool in the stands and frankly provide money that tamped down the very exercise of these Cuban peoples freedom."" Biden did eventually--more than a week later--issue sanctions against some Cuban officials. And his White House did eventually acknowledge the woes of Communism. But the hesitancy on display from Democrats unwilling to challenge the ideology that also fuels their socialist left flank is something Pompeo zoned in on in this exclusive interview with Breitbart News backstage last week at the Family Leadership Summit here in downtown Des Moines. An event that also featured former Vice President Mike Pence and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem this year, the Family Leadership Summit served as a springboard for Trumps nascent presidential campaign in 2015--his appearance there helped catapult him to the front of the 2016 GOP presidential pack, and he eventually won the GOP nomination and the presidency a year and a half later. The interview with Pompeo aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend. Asked if he is considering a presidential campaign of his own in 2024--Pompeo is widely regarded as a potential successor to Trump--the former presidents top diplomat said he is focused squarely on the midterm elections for now and working to help Republicans up and down the ballot nationwide through his group CAVPAC--the acronym stands for Championing American Values (CAV) PAC. ""Im here in Iowa to help candidates be successful when going into 2022,"" Pompeo said. ""Thats the mission set. Its what CAVPAC is aimed at. Weve lived the CAVPAC dream these last six months, and that is championing American values and riding to the sound of the guns. When 2022 is over, then well go figure out whats next. I know Ill stay in the fight--whether that fight turns out to be running for office or doing something else, these ideas--these conservative ideas--matter to me and Im going to go try to have an impact and make a difference."" Pompeo gave a series of speeches and took questions from Iowans at events earlier in the day last Friday in both northern Des Moines in the Ankeny neighborhood and up in Ames, Iowa, during which a common question was what represents the biggest threat to the United States--foreign adversaries or domestic subversion? Pompeo said, while he regularly fights back against the former, the latter could undo the country from within. ""My understanding is precisely in line with how the founders thought about America,"" Pompeo said. ""They knew we would have adversaries that would want to present risk to us, but if we screwed our Constitution up--if we walked away from these ideas of freedom and liberty and protecting the unborn, all the things that America was built on--if we didnt get those conservative principles and those constitutional ideas right, then thats how the republic falls. It happens from the inside. Its like a disease. The real risk is what happens inside. The biggest threats to the republic come from things like Critical Race Theory, folks who say you are racist if you say our founding began in 1776--something that is historically accurate fact--or if you deny systemic racism and those ideas begin to be transmitted across the years and across the generations in our kindergartens and our high schools and our universities. Thats the risk, that America loses its understanding of what made it so great and walks away from them."" Pompeo praised parents nationwide for fighting back against Critical Race Theory. ""Yeah, theyve had enough. Youre not going to teach our kids this garbage,"" Pompeo said. ""This is why youre seeing these parents rise up. Its interesting, youre seeing it in these school boards, but youre also seeing people say 'Im going to go run for city council. Im going to go be a member of the board of regents. You see people that are furious about the crime in their communities and they go make sure their county sheriff is going to enforce the law. Every element, all across America, youre seeing conservative believers rise up and say, 'Were not going to take this anymore and 'Were not going to allow our country to head down this path of chaos and anarchy and 'Were going to go live in an America that looks like the one that made this country so unique."" Another common refrain from questioners at the Iowa events was how to combat what is colloquially known as the ""Deep State""--the myriad federal agencies and bureaucrats and bureaucracies quickly adopting things like Critical Race Theory and working to undermine people like Pompeo and Trump when they were in office. One person even mentioned the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, promoting Critical Race Theory during a recent congressional hearing. Asked about it, Pompeo gave a blueprint for how to fight back. ""You have to do two things--one, you have to win elections and second you have to be absolutely fearless in talking about these risks,"" Pompeo said. ""I lived it. When I ran the State Department, this was an institution that was long populated by people that didnt want to have very much to do with President Trump and Mike Pompeo. They had a very different view--they had the establishment, consensus foreign policy view. As a leader, as someone who was nominated and confirmed by the duly elected president, my responsibility was to go deliver what the American people had asked President Trump to do. I watch--I was a soldier a long time ago--I watch whats happening inside our military, what theyre teaching some of our military kids, and its frightening. The focus of the military has to be singular: Break stuff, and kill people when the Commander in Chief asks you to do it to defend our freedom. Im happy to have a diverse military, I think thats a good thing, but we cant have the priority be political correctness or this idea that somehow our military is racist. This is an institution that has historically been on the vanguard of racial equality. Its a step backwards. I hope that our generals do general stuff, and our politicians do political stuff--and neither of the two should cross."" Whats more, Pompeo said the Biden administration has zero serious accomplishments now more than seven months into this experiment of complete Democrat control in Washington, D.C. ""Im not sure what they would list as their accomplishments today other than spending a whole lot of money and getting almost nothing for it, supporting the furthest left elements within their party whether that is with Critical Race Theory, or their unwillingness to denounce Communism,"" Pompeo said. ""The Cuban people rise up and it takes someone in their administration 48 hours to admit Communism is bad? Weve also seen inflation beginning to run rampant--they wont push back against these mayors in these cities who refuse to enforce the rules and tamp down violence. Weve seen some of the highest murder rates in history. Weve also seen them continue to hide behind this virus and put clampdowns and restrictions in in a way that is unscientific. This is an administration that has just taken up the furthest left elements in their party and put that at the center and I think, too, that this is not just--when you see these parents rising up, when you see the energy the conservative movement has, I think its deeply connected to what they see the administration doing when they are essentially given the entire football field to run all across, and Im convinced that if we work hard and get the message right about freedom, that well have a very successful election 18 months from now."" Pompeo also said that the key to his success as Trumps Secretary of State was remembering when he would be meeting with an American adversary who he was representing back home. He said the things he would seek to accomplish--the adverse actions of Americas enemies and adversaries--would have reverberating consequences to people in the heartland of the United States. ""Whenever I was traveling, I would think of the people I knew back in Kansas where I was a representative for six years,"" Pompeo said. ""That was the image in my head when I was sitting across the table from Vladimir Putin or Chairman Kim or the Taliban for that matter. How do I preserve their way of life so they can raise their families? Look, its a complicated question. What happens in Beijing doesnt stay in Beijing. The Chinese Communist Party wants to steal American jobs. They come and they steal our intellectual property and then they dump the products back here destroying millions of jobs in places like Iowa and Kansas. There are real economic impacts. You talked about energy. We wanted to export American energy around the world to tie other nations closer to ours and create wealth for Americans and good jobs all across Texass panhandle, West Virginia, Pennsylvania--these were good-paying energy jobs. This president has shut that all in and then realized 'Oh we have a problem because gas is going up and then asked the Saudis to pump more oil when we could do it here at home. This is the fundamental misunderstanding and the naivete this administration has had for so long about the things that underwrite and secure American freedom."" In that vein, Pompeo also noted--as he did in speeches throughout his time in Iowa last Friday--that he and President Trump did not start any new foreign wars and worked to end wars, including in Afghanistan where Pompeo negotiated out a blueprint with the Taliban that set into motion the end of the war in Afghanistan. Biden has generally kept the parameters of the deal, but delayed its timeline to try to take credit for an end to the war, but it was Trump and Pompeo who began that--as Pompeo made clear in this interview. ""We understood that protecting and preserving American freedom didnt depend on us having soldiers stationed everywhere and always,"" Pompeo said. ""We had economic tools, we had diplomatic tools, we had all of the alliances we were able to form so we crushed the caliphate, took down ISIS--an Islamic terrorist group that had real estate the size of the United Kingdom--we eliminated it and then we got home. We got our kids back. Then, in Afghanistan, we prevented terror attacks--we didnt have any American attacked from the first time I went to meet with the Taliban until the time we left office. We reduced our footprint and the costs associated with that. We need to ask our friends and allies that in the first instance they need to protect themselves. We will be there to provide the things that they need to secure their freedom, it matters to us, but we were determined to deliver good diplomatic outcomes to secure and protect American commerce but do so without having to put our young men and women who serve in the military in harms way.""

Republican Lawmakers Call for Tribunal of Human Rights Abuses in Cuba,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/22/time-to-end-plague-of-communism-republicans-call-for-criminal-tribunal-of-human-rights-abuses-in-cuba/,07/22/21,www.breitbart.com,"More than 140 Republican lawmakers led by Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sent a letter to the Organization of American States, the E.U., and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday demanding action against Cubas communist regime -- including an international criminal tribunal. The letter read: After more than six decades of brutally oppressive rule, the Cuban people are risking their lives to loudly denounce the disastrous communist regime that has time and time again failed to promote and protect the general welfare of its citizens. It is time to finally end the evil and murderous reign of the communist, illegitimate Cuban regime that has murdered, tortured and oppressed for far too long. The letter comes a week after Cubas largest anti-government protests in decades broke out in more than 40 municipalities on the island. Protesters were met with gunfire and beaten in the streets. Independent media in Cuba estimated that as many as 5,000 people have been arrested or disappeared since protests began, Breitbart News reported, though the names of only about 600 individuals are confirmed. Current figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel openly called on civilians to violently attack protesters on the streets in an ""order of combat"" issued last week. In the letter, lawmakers suggested an international criminal tribunal be established to investigate Cubas alleged crimes against humanity. Lawmakers named organizations like Justice Cuba, Cuba Archives, and the Cuban American Bar Association, which ""have already been compiling the names and crimes of those who have committed human rights abuses."" The Justice Cuba International Commission previously presented testimony from former political prisoners who witnessed torture and atrocities perpetrated by the Cuban government. As Breitbart News previously reported, Justice Cuba compiled legal evidence and completed its investigation into Cubas human rights abuses in 2018. At the time, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) urged former President Donald Trumps administration to indict former Cuban dictator Raul Castro, but action was never taken. Since then, the organization has been in search of a tribunal in order to ""successfully try Cuban government officials accused of torture and other atrocities against the population on the island."" ""We encourage you to work with us in forming an International Criminal Tribunal for Cuba for crimes against humanity and work to hold the Communist regime accountable,"" lawmakers said in the letter. In addition to a tribunal, Republicans want the international community to ""immediately end diplomatic relations"" and ""end all financial support to the regime."" The letter continued: A full withdrawal of financial support by the international community will end a critical lifeline that allows the Cuban regime to maintain its tight grip on power. Any nation that stands for freedom, democracy and human rights cannot also continue to support the communist Cuban regimes brutal oppression with appeasement policies in the form of increased trade, tourism, extensions of credit or investments in joint ventures with the regime. Republicans slammed the ""failed appeasement policies of the Obama-Biden administration"" which ""did nothing to promote freedom for the Cuban people or end the oppression forced on them by Cubas malevolent dictatorship."" Lawmakers said, ""it only emboldened the regime and funded its campaign of oppression."" ""All money that goes into Cuba through any trade, tourism or commercial relationship directly enriches the regime,"" lawmakers said in the letter. Lawmakers additionally asked the international community to work collaboratively to coordinate democratic assistance for the ""brave Cuban freedom advocates,"" and emphasized the importance of giving Cubans Internet access to communicate with the outside world. Social media allowed information and photos of the Cuba protests to widely circulate, enabling thousands of Cubans to join in before the regime shut down Internet access on the island. The letter continues: A primary weapon of dictatorships like the Cuban regime is silencing their opposition: they stop them from talking to each other, from receiving information from those around the world who want to help them, and from getting the images of the regimes oppression to the outside world. Overall, lawmakers said the 62-year-old regime, the oldest dictatorship on the Western Hemisphere, has remained in tact long enough without being held accountable: Its time to end this terrible plague of communism on the Cuban people. Its time for freedom and democracy to prevail. We urge you to stand up for a free Cuba and show your commitment to freedom with immediate action to support their cause. The time for democracy in Cuba is now. The request for action comes as Democrats and Republicans spar over how to handle Cuba. Many Democrats have sought to blame the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba for the islands problems, while most Republicans and protesters blame Cubas corrupt Communist government. After more than a week of inaction, President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the U.S. will sanction ""one Cuban individual and one Cuban entity for serious human rights abuse."" His administration is also reportedly working with the private sector to figure out how to restore Internet to the island and will restaff the U.S. Embassy in Havana (where several ambassadors were mysteriously sickened), among other measures.",
Cuba: Police Arrest Mothers of Political Prisoners to Block Protest,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2021/07/22/cuba-police-rip-people-off-sidewalks-to-block-protest-by-political-prisoner-mothers/,07/22/21,www.breitbart.com,"An attempt to hold nationwide marches Wednesday to demand the Cuban Communist Party reveal the whereabouts and health status of hundreds, if not thousands, of people arrested and disappeared on July 11 prompted heavy police presence and ""preemptive"" arrests of people suspected to be attending. Thousands of protesters organized dozens of local marches throughout the island of Cuba on July 11 demanding an end to the communist regime. The earliest reports of protests on that day came from San Antonio de los Banos, a Havana suburb, but spread all the way to Santiago de Cuba on the other side of the island. Holguin and Camaguey, eastern Cuba, documented some of the largest peaceful marches anywhere in the country. Despite the protests being overwhelmingly peaceful - and the Cuban population not enjoying the right to bear arms - the Communist Party responded to the protests with extreme repression. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the figurehead representing the Castro family regime, delivered remarks on national television urging civilians to commit violent assaults on people suspected to be ""counter-revolutionaries."" Diaz-Canel described his command as an ""order of combat."" In addition to encouraging vigilante violence - and, evidence suggests, organizing armed civilian gangs to attack suspected dissidents - the Castro regime engaged in mass arrests, public beatings, and disappearances of dissidents. Cuba Decide, a human rights advocacy group, has confirmed the arrests or disappearances of 667 people nationwide since July 11, of which 526 remain in police custody. This does not include people under house arrest - including many prominent independent journalists, prevented from doing their jobs - and experts say the number is artificially deflated by the difficulty of reaching some parts of remote Cuba. The true number, advocates say, could be in the thousands. To raise awareness of the mass arrests, the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organize the families of the imprisoned and disappeared, called for a protest beginning at 11 a.m. on Wednesday nationwide. The group used word of mouth - the government shut down the internet after the protests - to urge peaceful marches in every city in the country demanding only to know the fates of their children. It actively encouraged only mothers of those arrested to participate; supporters were told to line the streets, not march. The Movement of July 11 Mothers adopted the same tactic used by one of Cubas largest dissident groups, the Ladies in White - a coalition of mothers, wives, sisters, and brothers of political prisoners beaten and arrested during the Black Spring communist crackdown of 2003. While many of those imprisoned in 2003 have since been released, the Ladies in White have continued their singular act of protest every week: wearing white and carrying images of their loved ones, attempting to attend Catholic Mass in silence. The Castro regime forced the Catholic Church during the Obama era to ban the women from attending Mass. To prevent the creation of a second Ladies in White phenomenon, the Castro regime flooded Havana with police cars Wednesday and actively arrested people suspect of planning to attend any anti-government marches. Dissidents managed to record the arrest of two such people and smuggle the video out of Cuba. Marthadela Tamayo and Osvaldo Navarro were walking down the street, apparently peacefully, when state security agents intercepted and arrested them, based on no apparent criminal activity. No evidence exists that the agents had a warrant against them or reason to believe they were a threat to society. The couple were, however, on their way to the meeting point of the July 11 Mothers march. Navarro himself took the video. The video shows police officers intercepting the couple. Navarro can be heard repeatedly asking of police, ""dont touch her,"" referring to Tamayo, then asking, ""where are we going?"" Police do not respond and at no point appear to explain why the couple is being taken into custody. Diario de Cuba, which reported details of the video arrest, noted that its own journalist ""Jorge Enrique Rodriguez"" was ""intercepted"" on his way to the marchs meeting point and threatened with arrest if he did not immediately return home and stay there. At least one other journalist, Juan Manuel Moreno, was arrested along with his wife Zelandia de la Caridad for attempting to attend the march. ""They have state security forces along with auxiliary forces from the Ministry of the Interior blocking roads to prevent the protest,"" activist Juan Antonio Madrazo told the Miami-based AmericaTeVe of Havana. Madrazo also confirmed the authenticity of the above arrest video and noted that many who wished to attend the protests endured similar repression. The Communist Party of Cuba has plainly denied the existence of any political prisoners or disappeared protesters. ""In Cuba, There Are No Disappeared or Tortured People,"" a headline in Granma, the official newspaper of the Party, read Wednesday. The denial echoes a remark by dictator Raul Castro during a press conference alongside then-President Barack Obama in 2016, in which he replied to a question about the fate of the islands political prisoners by CNN reporter Jim Acosta. ""What political prisoners?"" Castro replied. ""Give me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately."" Multiple human rights groups indeed produced a list of prisoners of conscience in Cuba, which Castro then ignored.",

MIAMI - A small group of protesters met Friday morning at a marina behind Bayside before they headed toward Cuba. The group left shortly before 8 a.m., and will stop in Key West to refuel before making their way toward the island. The protesters who planned the event want to show their support for the Cuban people who are going through a humanitarian crisis. They want to show their solidarity with the thousands of Cubans who continue to protest on the island, calling for an end to the decades-old communist regime. ""Its super important because Im Cuban. You know, I left when I was 13 years old, so its super important and just like all of them, supporting my family, supporting, you know, the people in Cuba,"" one boater said while pointing to the other boaters who had gathered. The group isnt trying to take anything to the island, but are doing this strictly to show support for people in Cuba. ""We want the Cuban community to see us and see that were there to help them out,"" Osdany Veloz said. Ad One Cuban woman, Elizabeth Cintra Garcia recorded video of herself before she presented herself at a military unit after she was cited following those widespread protests two weekends ago on the island. A group of protesters met Friday morning at a marina behind Bayside as they plan to head 12 miles off the shore of Cuba. Her mother says Cintra Garcia remains detained in a womens prison in Santa Clara, charged with disrespect of authorities, epidemic spread, public disorder and inciting others to protest. Reports continue to come out of Cuba that protesters are being sentenced to jail without just trials. Cintra Garcias mother said she has no words to express her pain as her 20-year-old daughter is now awaiting trial simply for protesting the government. Shes calling on the international community to speak up on behalf of all the young people in Cuba who will be unjustly prosecuted. In her video, Cintra Garcia said if anything happens to her, she blames the Cuban government. ""I was born in Cuba and my family is Cuba and I just hurt for the Cuban people,"" explained Luis Machado of SOS Cuba Flotilla. ""I just want to help get their message out there."" Ad ""Everybody is trying something different, a different way of getting to the media, and this is the other way to get to the media.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard will be checking the South Florida protesters boats by air and water, but will not be escorting them toward the island. ""We are not escorting folks and we have had zero permits submitted for anyone to cross into Cuban territorial waters,"" Petty Officer Nicole Groll, of the U.S. Coast Guard, told Local 10 News. ""So essentially, these folks are going boating, and theyre going boating together and from what I understand (its) a small group, and if they go into international waters, thats up to them. As long as they do not cross into Cuban territorial waters, nothing they are doing is illegal."" The group plans to stay on idle surrounding the island and at sunset, they will light up the sky with Chinese lanterns, fireworks and flares to let the island nation know theyre in support of their cause. Ad ""Theyre gonna physically see the fireworks, theyre going to physically see the boats there, so I think its going to be something that is very strong and very powerful for them,"" Veloz said. Groll said the Coast Guard is urging the boaters to save their flares for an emergency situation. Coast Guard volunteer, Jim Gillernan, inspected the boats before they headed out. ""Where these boats are going is into the straits of Florida, and those folks that have been into the straits of Florida know the straits of Florida can be a pretty treacherous body of water pretty quickly,"" said Gillernan. The Coast Guard will monitor their voyage and will be on stand-by in case of an emergency. ""Once we get to international waters, were going to wait until the sun goes down to be able to launch some flares, some fireworks, and be seen,"" Veloz added. An avid boater told Local 10 News that it takes four to five hours to get from Miami to Key West by boat, and then, depending on the boat, about four hours or more to get from Key West to Cuba. Ad The group expects to arrive 15 nautical miles outside of Havana by 5:30 p.m. and will head back to Key West at sunset. ""My message to the Cuban people is to stay strong, keep fighting for your rights and Cuba libre hopefully soon,"" Veloz said. Machado added, ""Family members came here on a raft.

Cuba: Police Threaten Hospitalized Teen Shot in Protests,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/23/cuba-police-threaten-hospitalized-teen/,07/23/21,www.breitbart.com,"The parents of a 16-year-old currently recovering from a gunshot wound incurred in a police interaction during the July 11 protests in Cuba said on Thursday that state security agents had visited the boy without parental consent in his hospital room to threaten him with prison time. The teen, identified as Yoel Misael Fuentes Garcia, was shot in the leg in La Guinera, a neighborhood of Havana, while attempting to approach the sounds of a tumultuous crowd he would later come to know were protesters. According to Diario de Cuba, which interviewed his step-father, Fuentes was not actively participating in anti-government protests but simply went outside to investigate the loud noises he could hear from his home. Thousands of Cubans are believed to have taken the streets on July 11 to call for an end to the 62-year-old Castro regime. While some of the largest protests, like the one Fuentes encountered, occurred in Havana, dozens of cities nationwide reported peaceful marches and assemblies in public calling for freedom from the Communist Party. The protests were the culmination of mounting unrest during the past decade when a Castro regime emboldened by concessions under President Barack Obama greatly increased repression of dissidents, artists, and others who threatened to challenge the party line in public. Janoi Ceballos, Fuentes stepfather, told Diario de Cuba that communist authorities did not allow the boys family into his hospital room but did allow police officers to enter the room to threaten him with prison time. ""We, the relatives, had to see Yoelito through a glass in the hospital. Meanwhile, a police officer went directly to his bed to interrogate and coerce him,"" Ceballos said. ""He told him that they could take him to 100 y Aldabo."" 100 y Aldabo is one of Cubas most notorious prisons. Survivors of the prison have accused Cuban authorities of psychologically and physically torturing inmates; it has maintained a reputation for decades of being the prison where authorities send prisoners they wish to ""break"" to testify against others. Ceballos emphasized that no evidence supports any claim that his stepson participated in the protests or engaged in any criminal activity. Protests - or any publicly expressed sentiment - against the regime in Cuba often result in criminal charges such as ""disorderly conduct"" or the uniquely Cuban crime of desacato (""disrespect""). ""Police, attempting to disperse the protest, shot all the time against unarmed protesters. My stepson got hit in the leg and he will recover, but another person there died, his mother is doing very poorly,"" Ceballos added. ""Until now, no authority at any level has come to offer an apology for hurting my stepson, which would be the minimum they should do since he ... just got close out of curiosity to see what was happening."" Fuentes has since been discharged from the hospital. The casualty toll of the July 11 protests - and subsequent protests occurring throughout the country on a nearly daily basis since then - remains largely a mystery as the Castro regime has shut down the internet nearly nationwide, imprisoned and assaulted journalists, and otherwise impeded human rights groups from keeping a tally. Officially, the regime claims only one person, Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, died in the protests. Police reportedly shot Tejeda dead in the back. Dissident organizations on the island and families of those affected have managed to help international groups keep a better estimate of the number of imprisoned and disappeared Cubans since protests began. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), an NGO operating out of Spain, revealed on Friday that as of that day, it has confirmed the arrests of 757 people across the island. Of these people, 13 are believed to be children. The group noted that it had made ample use of social media video to confirm many of the arrests and lamented that the Castro regime had shut off the internet, making those videos harder to obtain, during a press conference on Friday. It added that a nationwide manhunt continues for participants in the protests still at large. Evidence from relatives following the ordeals of the protesters suggests that none can expect fair judgment under the law. Cuban Prisoners Defenders, an NGO that documents the malignant use of the law on the island to repress dissenters, revealed this week that the Castro regime is denying most protesters basic due process rights like the right to an attorney or the right to know what crime they are being charged with in a reasonable amount of time. ""The summary 'trials, with no lawyers or possible defense, are happening simultaneously in numbers of ten accused at a time, and we have even had knowledge of cases of 30 accused [processed] simultaneously,"" the organization denounced. ""We are talking about hundreds of people being processed, if not thousands. Extremely grave."" The longest processed cases, the group noted, have lasted only about 96 hours from arrest to conviction. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
'Symbolic but Meaningless': Biden Sanctions One Person in Cuba,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/23/biden-sanctions-cuba-protest-crackdown/,07/23/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions against Cuban security minister Gen. Alvaro Lopez Miera and a security unit of the Cuban Interior Ministry for their role in cracking down on protesters. The sanctions were denounced as ""unfounded and slanderous"" by the Cuban regime, and as ""symbolic but meaningless"" by critics such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who noted Miera is already under sanctions. Biden sanctioning an already sanctioned regime official in #Cuba is the kind of symbolic but meaningless measure we will continue to see as long as @potus is being advised by people who were drinking mojitos in Havana in 2015 to celebrate the Obama policy#CubaLibre -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 23, 2021 ""The actions of Cuban security forces and violent mobs mobilized by Cuban Communist Party First Secretary Miguel Diaz-Canel lay bare the regimes fear of its own people and unwillingness to meet their basic needs and aspirations,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken when announcing the sanctions on Thursday. ""Today, the United States is imposing sanctions on Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba Alvaro Lopez Miera and the Cuban Ministry of the Interiors Special National Brigade or 'Boinas Negras (Black Berets),"" Blinken said. ""Lopez Miera and the Special National Brigade have been involved in suppressing the protests, including through physical violence and intimidation."" Miera and the Black Berets were added to the U.S. Treasury Departments list of ""specially designated nationals"" under the Global Magnitsky Act, which authorizes sanctions against foreign nationals for corruption and human rights abuses. ""The Cuban people are protesting for the fundamental and universal rights they deserve from their government,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""Treasury will continue to enforce its Cuba-related sanctions, including those imposed today, to support the people of Cuba in their quest for democracy and relief from the Cuban regime."" President Joe Biden said the sanctions are ""just the beginning"" and the U.S. will ""continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people."" ""The Cuban people have the same right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as all people. The United States stands with the brave Cubans who have taken to the streets to oppose 62 years of repression under a communist regime,"" Biden said. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez responded on Twitter, calling the sanctions ""unfounded and slanderous"" and suggesting the U.S. government should punish itself for ""systematic repression and police brutality that took the lives of 1021 persons in 2020."" Rodriguez threatened the U.S. with ""grave consequences"" for its ""irresponsible conduct."" The Black Berets have been caught on video using excessive violence against peaceful protesters. One woman provided video of Black Berets shooting her husband and carting him off in a wheelbarrow while their children watched. Another woman said her son, an independent journalist named Henry Constantin, was arrested while covering the protests and taken to his home by the Black Berets so they could confiscate his computers and other equipment. Constantins colleagues say he and his producer and editor have been taken to a detention facility known as ""the place where everyone sings"" due to its ""methods of greater severity in interrogations."" Cuban democracy activists said the regime shut down power and Internet service so it would be harder for victims of the Black Berets to upload footage of the brutal units human rights abuses. The UK Daily Mail on Thursday quoted skeptics who said the Biden administrations tepid action would have little practical effect on the Cuban regime or its stormtroopers, beyond mildly embarrassing the Black Berets and making them wonder if they might be held personally accountable for their actions: Giancarlo Sopo, who was rapid response director for Spanish-language media on President Trumps re-election campaign, said: 'US law already prohibits transactions with the Cuban military. The Cuban military does not have property in the US. But a Cuban-American lawyer, speaking on anonymity because of the sensitivity of sanctions cases, said the repercussions of such a public naming and shaming would be felt in a country that relies on anonymity and a 'just following orders mentality. 'As a practical matter theres little that will change in their financial life, he said. 'But put yourself in their shoes, you have have now been identified in a very public way. As Sen. Rubio pointed out, the entire Cuban Interior Ministry was already targeted for sanctions by the Trump administration under the Global Magnitsky Act in January, including the Black Berets. Under the Trump sanctions, ""all property and interests in property"" of the ministry and its leader, Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas, was frozen. ""U.S. officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have U.S. financial dealings and seldom travel to the United States, limiting the practical impact of such measures,"" Reuters noted on Thursday.",
WH Offers No Update on Biden Proposal to Restore Cuba Internet,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/23/eight-days-later-joe-biden-still-exploring-options-on-restoring-cubas-internet/,07/23/21,www.breitbart.com,"President Joe Biden is still exploring options to restore Internet access to Cuba after the regime shut it down on July 11, the White House claimed on Friday. The Communist government of Cuba cut Internet access on the island in response to protests that began that day, preventing protesters from communicating or organizing as the political uprising for freedom continues. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not have an update to the presidents claim last Thursday that he was exploring the possibility of the United States intervening by offering restored Internet access to the country. ""Theyve cut off access to the Internet,"" Biden said during a press conference last week. ""Were considering whether we have the technology to reinstate that access."" Biden spoke about the idea after Governor Ron DeSantis and other Florida Republicans sent a letter urging him to explore options. ""The one thing that communist regimes fear the most is the truth, and if we are able to help Cubans communicate with one another and with the outside world, that truth is going to matter,"" DeSantis wrote. But Biden still has not acted. When asked for an update to the presidents promise -- and if the administration would consider using high-tech balloons to provide Cubans with Internet access, Psaki replied, ""I wish it was that easy."" ""We are exploring a range of options. We are quite focused and interested in restoring internet access to the people of Cuba,"" she added. Psaki did not explain why the United States had not yet acted to help Cubans restore Internet access, but endorsed the idea. ""We feel if we could get it done it would be a great step forward and beneficial to the people of Cuba,"" she said. Biden faces continued criticism for being too slow to react to Cubas protests and remaining unwilling to act definitively to assist the movement. Former President Donald Trump criticized Bidens reaction to the protests during an interview with Telemundo. ""I think hes from a different planet; he doesnt understand the plight of the people of Cuba,"" Trump said, referring to Biden. ""What this administration is doing is just going to prolong it [the Castro regime].""",
Relatives: Cubans arrested after protests face summary trial,https://apnews.com/article/cuba-trials-arrests-7aac03b03e73f0b2c8e18e81a6469560,07/23/21,apnews.com,"HAVANA (AP) -- Relatives and friends of Cubans arrested during the unprecedented recent protests on the island said authorities are carrying out summary trials at a time when Cubas government is receiving criticism from international groups and governments, including the U.S., for its crackdown on the demonstrations. Martha Acosta, mother of 38-year-old plastic artist Carlos Gonzalez Acosta, told The Associated Press that her son was sentenced to 10 months in prison on Tuesday for public disorder. She said she wasnt able to attend the trial in Havana because she was not informed of it until it was over. ""It doesnt seem fair to me. My son has no record, he is not a criminal,"" said Acosta. She said the family will appeal the sentence before a tribunal. After being sentenced, Gonzalez was sent to the Havanas Valle Grande jail. He is only one of an unspecified number of people arrested after the July 11 protests, when thousands of Cubans took to the streets of the capital and other cities to protest food shortages and high prices during the pandemic. ADVERTISEMENT The Cuban government hasnt said how many were detained, but some NGOs, like Human Rights Watch, have made public lists with the names of more than 500 people allegedly arrested or missing. Amid the criticism, the U.S. government on Thursday reinforced sanctions on some Cuban officials. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control listed Alvaro Lopez Miera, Cubas Minister of the Armed Forces, and the Brigada Especial Nacional del Ministerio del Interior, or Interior Ministry Special Brigade, as among those who will face the latest sanctions. Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Bruno Rodriguez has denied there are people missing or that detainees are being mistreated, saying authorities are only applying the law.

Another plastic artist, Julio Llopiz-Casal, who was part of the protests, told the AP that he is at his house, but theres an official in plain clothes in front of it, and he has decided not to leave it.",

Cuba, which kept coronavirus infections low last year, earlier this week reported the highest rate of contagion per capita in Latin America. That has strained its healthcare sector and helped stoke rare anti-government protests earlier this month on the Communist-run island.

The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by decades-old U.S. embargo. Government critics say the island's economic woes are caused largely by the inefficiencies of the state-run system. Mexico said on Thursday it would send to Cuba two navy ships loaded with medical and food supplies, including syringes, oxygen tanks and masks, along with powered milk, cans of tuna, beans, flour, cooking oil and gasoline. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has blamed the U.S. embargo for fomenting the unrest in Cuba.

The cases were over minor charges, and the total number of people detained has not been released amid complaints from relatives seeking information about loved ones. ""Until yesterday, 19 judicial processes had reached the municipal courts of the country - cases involving 59 people accused of committing alleged crimes (during) these disturbances,"" Ruben Remigio Ferro, president of the Supreme Court, told reporters on Saturday. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in several locations, including the capital Havana, on July 11 and 12 to demand government action amid an economic crisis and food shortages made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. The protesters shouted ""Freedom"", ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""Were hungry"" in what were the largest protests on the island in decades. Reed Lindsay, a Havana-based journalist with news outlet Belly of the Beast, said Ferros news conference was ""a response to a lot of the international press coverage, a lot of whats going on on social media"" about the detained protesters. ""Some of the accusations against the government are that no lawyer has been provided to people who have gone to trial, that these have been summary trials - and the government did push back against that,"" Lindsay told Al Jazeera. ""The president of the Supreme Court said that they were not summary trials - that they were brief trials - but that they were sort of still in process,"" said Lindsay, who added that Ferro also notably said: ""Mistakes may have been made and they could be corrected in the judicial process."" ""It left open the possibility for some of these maybe more minor offences, for people to be released,"" Lindsay said. Hundreds of people were arrested during the demonstrations and many face charges of contempt, public disorder, vandalism and propagation of the coronavirus pandemic for allegedly marching without face masks. Independent observers and activists have published lists of those arrested - there are at least 600 names. The UNs human rights chief on July 16 called on Cuba to release protesters and several journalists who were also arrested. In a statement, Michelle Bachelet slammed the Cuban governments response, saying ""it is particularly worrying"" that those arrested included ""individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are unknown"". Ferro on Saturday said a faster trial system was being used to prosecute the accused but made assurances that due process was being followed.",

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during a ceremony marking the third anniversary of his presidential election at the National Palace in Mexico City, Thursday, July 1, 2021. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Saturday that Cuba is an ""example of resistance,"" and proposed the entire country should be declared a World Heritage site. While much of Cuba seems stuck technologically in the middle of the last century, Lopez Obrador did not appear to be speaking ironically when he proposed the world heritage designation, which is usually used by the United Nations to honor historical sites. The Mexican leader praised Cubas ability to stand up to U.S. hostility since 1959. Lopez Obrador did not mention recent street protests that were violently repressed by the Cuban government. Lopez Obrador has in the past stated his opposition to U.S. sanctions that limit commerce with the island, and said they should be ended. Lopez Obrador also said the Organization of American States should be replaced ""by a body that is truly autonomous, not anybodys lackey."" ADVERTISEMENT Mexico has publicly disagreed with the OAS leadership over its role in the political situation in countries like Bolivia. Lopez Obrador spoke Saturday at a ceremony attended by Cubas foreign minister to mark the 238th birthday of Simon Bolivar, who led the fight to liberate several South American countries from Spanish rule in the early 1800s. The Mexican government has said it is sending two navy ships to Cuba with food and medical aid on Sunday. The Foreign Relations Department said the ships will will carry oxygen tanks, needles and syringes, and basic food items like rice and beans. The announcement came on Thursday, the same day that the U.S. government tightened the sanctions on some Cuban officials after they violently put down rare street protests earlier this month. The new sanctions target a Cuban official and a government special brigade the United States says was involved in human rights abuses during the government crackdown.",

The U.S. Coast Guard warned the boaters it would be illegal for them to depart U.S. waters with the intention of entering Cuban territorial waters. However, for those intending only to go near Cuban waters, the agency merely advised against doing so. The boats reportedly stayed in international waters.

Cuban leftists begin to turn their fire on the 'harmful practices of the state',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/25/cuban-leftists-begin-to-turn-their-fire-on-the-harmful-practices-of-the-state,07/25/21,www.theguardian.com,"Luis Emilio Aybar is a voice from the left, which in Cuba means pretty far left. By any measure, he should be a stalwart defender of the islands communist regime. After widespread public protests that two weeks ago roiled the nation, the 34-year-old published an article in the magazine La Tizza, which bills itself as ""a space to think about socialism"". After the prerequisite denunciation of the US, he wrote: ""What happened on 11 July is also because we communists and revolutionaries do not fight with sufficient force and efficiency the harmful practices of the state. ""We defend unity in a way that actually harms it ... We uncritically follow our leaders instead of rectifying their path. We agree to be disciplined, when what we have to do is think and act with our own heads."" In authoritarian Cuba, that sounded a lot like heresy. Cuba has always split international opinion. Its detractors are perhaps best represented by the US senator Marco Rubio, who called the island ""the only country in the world where Cubans cant succeed"". In turn, its supporters brook little criticism. Helen Yaffe, an author and academic from Glasgow University, recently arrived on the island, swiftly joining a government rally called by the government. Afterwards she declared on Novara Media: ""No one should underestimate the resilience of the Cuban revolution."" Within Cuba, the regime has long demanded such support, calling detractors gusanos, or worms. Yet the sight of thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to complain about a lack of food, medicines and electricity seems to have caused cracks to appear. Silvio Rodriguez is Cubas best-known singer-songwriter, a 74-year-old international superstar widely recognised as living his socialist values. In non-pandemic times, he stages monthly free concerts in the poorer barrios of Havana. Last week, however, he met the dissident playwright Yunior Garcia, who had been arrested during the protests. They discussed the unrest and the governments heavy-handed response. Shortly afterwards, Rodriguez called for the release of all those who had not resorted to violence. ""There must be less prejudice,"" he said. ""[There must be] more desire to solve the mountain of pending economic and political issues."" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio has blamed the US trade embargo for the demonstrations. Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP Criticism such as this has put the government on the defensive. It says the island has been subject to a wave of disinformation from the US. Carlos Fernandez de Cossio is Cubas point-man on the US, and second only to the foreign minister in importance at the ministry of foreign affairs. He insisted that claims that protesters had ""disappeared"" into jails and interrogation centres were just not true. ""There are people who have been detained and there are people that have been arrested, those that have violated the law,"" he said, although he would not give numbers. Independent media claim up to 650 people were detained, although many have now been released. Asked what he thought had brought Cubans on to the streets, De Cossio replied: ""Well, it wasnt capitalism."" The protesters had cried ""libertad"", freedom, and ""patria y vida"", homeland and life, the title of an anti-government song. The shortages they face are the result of Cuba running out of foreign currency, a situation hastened by the pandemic devastating an economy reliant on tourism. De Cossio blamed the 60-year-old US trade embargo, tightened to strangulation by Donald Trump and kept in place by Joe Biden. He said there had actually been more conversations with Washington during Trumps presidency than Bidens. ""Theres no dialogue at this moment,"" he said. Yet in his essay for La Tizza, Aybar strayed surprisingly close to another analysis, summarised by the Financial Times when it called Cuba a last ""lonely outpost of Marxist central planning"". ""During 2020, half of the countrys investments were allocated to hotel construction at a time when there was a drastic decrease in international tourism and an acute shortage of investment in agriculture,"" he wrote. He said 11 July needed to be a watershed. ""A failure to pressure the government from the left means that the right will take the initiative"", meaning ""more market, more private property, less education and public health."" Only time will reveal whether internal reform will satisfy the population. Another increasingly robust critic from within, Cubas former ambassador to the EU, Carlos Alzugaray, believes it will have to. He has just published an article saying it is ""essential"" that the government ""not make the mistake of blaming only external factors"". He was watching the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics on television as he pointed out that, despite the efforts of critics in the US, regimes such as China, Vietnam and Cuba have proved durable, and ""very difficult to overthrow"". It is his view that Cuba should follow China and Vietnam towards ""a market economy with socialist orientation"". Before he could get into that - or the governments potential reaction to the criticism from within - the pride in Cubas sovereignty that has always been a far greater and more unifying force than communism on the island revealed itself. The 69 athletes Cuba has sent to the Olympics appeared in the famous parade. Alzugaray faltered, his voice suddenly breaking with emotion.",

"Pandemic Advances Fast in Cuba, New Highs",https://havanatimes.org/features/pandemic-advances-fast-in-cuba-new-highs/,07/25/21,havanatimes.org,"By Circles Robinson Every morning at 9:00 AM, the National Director of Epidemiology of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Dr. Francisco Duran gives the latest report on the Covid-19 situation. HAVANA TIMES - Only two days ago we reported records of new Covid-19 positives for Cuba. Now those figures are a thing of the past. On Saturday the new high was 8,853 with 80 deaths in the country of 11.2 million persons. In comparison, Florida, also spiking with new cases, has a population of 21 million and recorded 10,452 new positives on Saturday with 39 deaths. As testing apparently increased in the eastern part of the island, Guantanamo is now the most hard-hit province per capita. In one day, the new positive cases shot up from 642 to 1,181. The far eastern province has a population of 511,000. A first-hand report to Havana Times indicates that the number of sick patients in Guantanamo is probably far greater than had been previously reported. No independent questioning of official data is allowed in Cuba. Matanzas with 712,000 inhabitants had 1,461 new positives on Saturday, the second most per capita, and Cienfuegos with 407,000 was third with 794 new Covid-19 positives. Havana had 1,481 in a population of 2,129,000. The Public Health Ministry has warned that the numbers will most likely get worse before they get better. The 80 deaths on Saturday were a new high from the previous 67. Cuba is also facing a critical food shortage situation. People must wait for hours on end in long crowded lines to try and purchase something to eat at the US dollar stores. Others without that currency must resort to the illicit market at even higher prices. Failed farm policies have meant agriculture production has been dropping for years and now the government doesnt have the funds for imports. It had been importing 60-80% of the food sold on the island in its monopoly retail market run mainly by Cimex, the giant military corporation. Private import/sales businesses are not allowed in the state-centered economy. Meanwhile, even the most basic medicines are absent from pharmacy shelves, not to mention the crisis for chronic illness patients. Many Covid-19 patients are also without the medicines they need, as confirmed by our source in Guantanamo. The government does not allow any private pharmacies to exist on the island. In both shortages, food and medicine, a popular saying sums up government policy. ""No pitchean ni dejan batear"" (They dont pitch or let any one else bat). A recent decision, after the massive July 11 protests, to allow vacationers to bring in extra food and medicines in their suitcases and not have them penalized or confiscated by Customs, will help some families but wont scratch the surface of a nationwide problem for the overall population. Also, the number of flights is severely limited due to the pandemic.",

Lopez Obrador said it was not enough for countries to vote to end the embargo via the United Nations General Assembly, but that it was time to make a real decision about it, given that ""almost all countries of the world"" are against it.

""How can it be blocked if it's not even government money?"" Lopez Obrador said. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism. The transfers have been slowed by policies brought in under U.S. former President Donald Trump that led Western Union to close Cuban operations. The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting economic hardship caused by decades-old U.S. embargo. Lopez Obrador says the U.S. embargo is a cause of the protests, which erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union in the 1990s.

Cuba Sentences Teen Girl to 8 Months House Arrest for Watching Protests,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/26/cuba-minor-house-arrest-watching-protests/,07/26/21,www.breitbart.com,"The family of 17-year-old Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez confirmed this weekend that the Communist Party of Cuba had sentenced her to eight months in prison for ""public disorder"" despite her insistence that she was not an active participant in the July 11 protests. After an international outcry followed the news that Zequeira would serve an eight-month sentence in one of Cubas most notorious political prisons, Cuban police altered the sentence to eight months of house arrest. Zequeira would retain her criminal record, however, despite being a minor, having no criminal history, and no evidence suggesting she was protesting the communist regime. Thousands of Cubans nationwide organized spontaneous protests on Sunday, July 11, calling for an end to the 62-year-old communist regime. The protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, consisting of marches in major city plazas and down the roads of smaller towns and villages. The Castro regime responded to the protests with disproportional violence, firing live ammunition into crowds and beating suspected protesters in public. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, the regime shut down nationwide access to the internet and ordered door-to-door raids of homes in the cities that had the largest protest turnout. The little video and images that Cubans have managed to smuggle out of the country indicate that police have identified protesters and beaten them in their own homes - in some cases shooting them despite them not appearing to present any threat - and disappeared them into the legal system. Human rights activists have denounced the regime for the mass arrest and disappearance of hundreds of people. Evidence compiled by non-governmental organizations indicates that the Castro regime is using mass sentencing procedures to rapidly process and imprison protesters. Zequeiras mother told the independent outlet Cubanet that her teen daughter was among those processed in such a way, arrested and processed in a ""trial"" with 11 other women. In between July 11, when she was arrested, and July 13, mother Yoanis Hernandez Cuadra knew nothing of her daughters fate - she had disappeared on her way to get a haircut, her mother said, in her native Havana. On July 13, police officers told Hernandez that her daughter had been arrested and was currently in 100 y Aldabo, one of Cubas most notorious political prisons. Officers told Hernandez, the mother said, that her daughter ""was not involved in protests and could leave with just a fine."" On July 22, Zequeira was sentenced to eight months in prison on charges of ""public disorder."" ""She was just watching because she had never seen a protest before,"" Hernandez told Cubanet. The mother noted that, among the 12 women and girls sentenced simultaneously in a summary trial was another 17-year-old girl alongside her mother. All left convicted of similar ""counterrevolutionary"" charges. The BBC confirmed on Monday that, in the early hours of that day, police had returned Zequeira to her house and sentenced her to house arrest instead of prison time, a decision that appeared to occur in response to international condemnation of the sentencing of a minor in a trial alongside adults that took minimal evidence into consideration. Hernandez told the BBC that Zequeira had suffered ""psychological abuse"" at 100 y Aldabo. Her descriptions included acts of torture like sleep deprivation. The Spanish NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders published a detailed analysis of the way the Cuban Communist Party has begun legally processing July 11 protesters. The group has documented cases of as many as 30 people being tried in the same procedure. The state is systematically denying the imprisoned basic due process rights like access to an attorney or even knowing what crime they stand accused of until as recently as an hour before the trial. A prosecutorial system barely exists, meaning police decide what to accuse prisoners of without prosecutors compiling indictments or formally charging them. ""From the time in which police open an 'investigation to the trial, the majority of cases last between 48 and 96 hours,"" Cuban Prisoners Defenders revealed. The Cuban dissident group Cuba Decide has documented 742 people either known to have been arrested or simply disappeared since July 11 as of Monday. On the list are the names of several prominent longtime political dissidents, including at least two arrested during the ""Black Spring"" protests of 2003: Angel Moya and Jose Daniel Ferrer. Also still missing is a man identified as Ernesto Frank Sanchez Aguilar who is not known to have participated in the July 11 protests but executed a single act of dissidence the next weekend: interrupting a large ""act of revolutionary affirmation"" orchestrated by the regime by shouting ""freedom!"" in front of international media cameras. Cuban state security agents proceeded to publicly beat him and take him away; his whereabouts remain unknown.

Earlier this month the Cuban people carried out the most widespread protests the country has seen in decades over food and medicine shortages, as well as power outages. The protests turned violent as participants clashed with the police. As previously reported by Fox News, the administration asked the State Department to review staffing levels at the embassy as a means to facilitate diplomatic and civil engagement, while it also engages with the private sector to make the internet more widely available to the countrys residents. Late last week Biden announced new sanctions against elements of the Cuban regime and said it will continue to designate Cuban officials responsible for violent repression and human rights violations. President Miguel Diaz-Canel gathered supporters in the streets following the mass demonstrations and delivered a speech where he partly blamed the U.S. embargo for the unrest.",

"Mexican fuel cargo for Cuba is sovereign decision, president says",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-fuel-cargo-cuba-is-sovereign-decision-president-says-2021-07-27/,07/27/21,www.reuters.com,"Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador delivers a speech on the third anniversary of his presidential election victory at National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico July 1, 2021. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido MEXICO CITY, July 27 (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Tuesday asserted his country's right to send fuel to Cuba and said U.S. sanctions on the island were ""inhumane,"" after a diesel cargo shipped by Mexico's state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos arrived in Cuba's Havana port. Mexico's left-leaning President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has criticized the U.S. embargo against Cuba and pledged support for the Communist-run island, which has been hit by a surge in coronavirus infections and an economic slump that triggered rare protests this month. A shipment of humanitarian aid departed from the Mexican port of Veracruz on Tuesday destined for Cuba, and another is scheduled to set sail on Wednesday, carrying food, oxygen tanks and other medical supplies, Mexico's foreign ministry said in a release. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""We are an independent nation,"" Lopez Obrador said at a news conference in response to a question about whether deliveries risked contravening the U.S. embargo on the Communist-run island. Lopez Obrador criticized policies he said made it difficult for ships that delivered goods to Cuba to then dock in U.S. ports, which constitutes one of the main aspects of the embargo. Mexico's foreign ministry said the aid is part of a cooperation agreement between Mexico and Cuba. Authorities in Havana have long said the decades-old U.S. embargo on Cuba has caused widespread hardship on the island, where thousands took to the streets this month in the protests. Cuban Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca welcomed on Monday Mexico's pledge of two shipments of aid: ""We are not alone,"" he said on Twitter. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment and the State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment. John S. Kavulich, president of New-York based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said there were no specific U.S. sanctions preventing the sale - or donation - of Mexican fuel to Cuba. ""The U.S. embargo on Cuba is not focused on Cuba's imports but on U.S exports to Cuba,"" Kavulich said, adding that the Caribbean island did not appear to be a foreign policy priority for U.S. President Joe Biden. Lopez Obrador, who on Monday called on Biden to ""make a decision"" about the ""inhumane"" embargo on Cuba, last week had anticipated that Mexico would send fuel to generate electricity for the island's hospitals. The Jose Maria Morelos II, a tanker owned and managed by a Pemex unit, departed last week from the Mexican port of Coatzacoalcos bound for the Caribbean, according to Refinitiv Eikon tanker monitoring data. The vessel, which is carrying some 100,000 barrels of diesel according to the foreign ministry's release, has not updated its port of destination, but it docked at the Havana port late on Monday, the Eikon data showed. read more It is yet unclear which Cuban entity will receive the fuel. Cuba's dependence on diesel has increased in recent years as power plants using fuel oil and crude have been in urgent need of investment and maintenance. The island is also struggling to supply power plants with natural gas, said Jorge Pinon from the University of Texas at Austin. An oil-for-services arrangement between Venezuela and Cuba ran afoul of U.S. sanctions on the South American oil producer when in 2019 the U.S. Department of Treasury blacklisted a group of tanker owners and vessels involved in the shipments, at the Venezuelan opposition's request. Cuba's economy has been damaged by Venezuela's collapse, along with a slump in tourism following the global coronavirus pandemic.

"'Free Cuba' Activist: Biden Spoke Up for BLM, but Is Silent on Cuban 'Genocide'",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/27/free-cuba-activist-biden-spoke-up-for-blm-but-is-silent-on-cuban-genocide/,07/27/21,www.breitbart.com,"An activist joining thousands at a protest in Washington, DC, on Monday told Breitbart News the Cuban-American community is dismayed with President Joe Biden ""not stepping up"" in defense of human rights on the island. Leticia, an activist at Mondays rally, described the Communist Partys orders for civilians to attack suspected protesters as a ""genocide"" given that the Cuban people have no right to bear arms and no way of defending themselves against state-sponsored violence. The assembly in Washington on Monday attracted thousands of people, potentially the largest ever of its kind in opposition to the Cuban Revolution in the United States. Protesters peacefully marched to the White House, urging Biden to take stronger actions to weaken the Castro regimes ability to attack its own people. Los cubanos tomaron la capital de EUA . Esta debe ser una de las protestas mas grandes de cubanos en Washington DC. El himno que los acompana es #PatriaYVida. pic.twitter.com/u0PZIeE3oH -- Norges Rodriguez (@norges14) July 26, 2021 Cuba experienced a nationwide wave of protests on July 11, attracting thousands to peacefully march in dozens of cities from one end of the island to the other. While the protests - calling for an end to 62 years of communist dictatorship - were overwhelmingly peaceful and reports indicate those involved were civilians with little or no history of dissident activity, the Castro regime responded by deploying state security agents to shoot at, publicly beat, and disappear people suspected of participating in the protests. President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the current face of the Castro regime, issued an ""order of combat"" in a televised speech that day ordering civilians to take the streets and violently assault anyone suspected of disagreeing with the communist ""Revolution."" ""We are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Diaz-Canel urged. ""The moment that Diaz-Canel in Cuba gave the order of combat to the people in Cuba that have no means of defending themselves, thats not even a civil war, thats genocide right there,"" Leticia, the protester in Washington, told Breitbart News. ""And Bidens silence is only saying that he is agreeing with that because when you stay in silence in front of a genocide, that only means that youre an ally or that you have something to gain from this."" Leticia recalled that Biden supported the Black Lives Matter movement. ""When it was all about Black Lives Matter, he really stepped up on that, so what about Cubans lives? It doesnt matter? What about these childrens lives, it doesnt matter? Where is the UNICEF, the organization for the children? Where is the United Nations?"" ""So that is our issue with Biden, that that administration has done nothing - not even emotional support for the people dying right now,"" the protester noted. ""Moms in Cuba are committing suicide right now because their children are literally bleeding to death and the mom had to commit suicide - not only one, some of them. ... None of this, theyre not even showing it on the news."" Leticia appeared to be referring to the case of the mother of Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, the only person the Communist Party has confirmed to have died in the protests. Tejeda, 36, was reportedly participating in protests when police opened fire on an unarmed crowd in Havana and died of gunshot wounds. Reports from Cuba following the confirmation of his death indicated that his mother, who has not been named, overdosed on unspecified medication deliberately following the death of her only son. Cuban human rights organizations have identified at least 742 people who are either confirmed in police custody or have disappeared since July 11, a significantly lower number than the estimated thousands actually imprisoned both on that day and during subsequent protests. Many of those on the confirmed list are well-known dissidents, which makes it easier to find someone to reach out to who can confirm their status. At the top of the list is the head of what is believed to be Cubas largest dissident organization, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), Jose Daniel Ferrer. Ferrers whereabouts remain unknown as of Tuesday and his family does not know what, if anything, police have charged him with. The mothers of the missing attempted to organize a protest last week demanding to know the status of their children. The Castro regime cut off access to the internet in the immediate aftermath of the protests, however, and deployed a massive state security presence around the homes of protest organizers to prevent them from leaving their homes. Videos surfacing from Havana show police abruptly plucking people off of the street who were suspected of attempting to reach an assembly point to support the group of mothers. The Biden administration has done little in response to the protests. Administration officials first dismissed the protests as a call for help fighting the Chinese coronavirus, not a demand for regime change. Biden himself later issued a tepid statement in support of the ""Cuban people"" and organized Zoom meetings with prominent Cuban-American celebrities Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia. Last week, Biden sanctioned on Cuban administration official, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the ""black beret"" Cuban special repression forces - both of whom Washington had already sanctioned under predecessor Donald Trump.

"3 Mexican ships taking fuel, medical aid and food to Cuba",https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-health-cuba-caribbean-ef152e53bb21cb483079875f75ecdb7f,07/27/21,apnews.com,"Children play on a street that has graffiti reading is Spanish ""Put your heart on Cuba,"" in Havana, Cuba, Monday, July 26, 2021 (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) Children play on a street that has graffiti reading is Spanish ""Put your heart on Cuba,"" in Havana, Cuba, Monday, July 26, 2021 (AP Photo/Eliana Aponte) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two Mexican ships carrying food, fuel and medical supplies were sailing to Cuba on Tuesday and a third was getting ready to head there Wednesday, in what experts said was Mexicos biggest aid run for Cuba in almost three decades. The first ship left late Monday loaded with 100,000 barrels of diesel fuel that the Mexican government said would be used to provide power for Cuban hospitals. A second ship operated by the Mexican navy left Tuesday, and the third ship will leave Wednesday. The Foreign Relations Department said those two ships are carrying oxygen tanks, needles and syringes as well as basic food items like powdered milk, cooking oil and beans. The department described the shipments as ""humanitarian assistance"" to help Cuba weather the coronavirus pandemic. Rafael Elias Rojas, a Cuban historian and professor at the College of Mexico, said that ""this is a new phenomenon,"" comparable only to Cubas ""special period"" in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union cut off the islands economic subsidies. ADVERTISEMENT ""There have been minor instances of aid during hurricane seasons, but the last big aid efforts of this scale or larger, were during the administration of (former Mexican president) Carlos Salinas de Gortari, when exchanges with Cuba increased significantly and when, as now, there was a deep economic crisis on the island,"" Rojas said. Carlos Salinas de Gortari governed from 1988 to 1994. And until Mexicos democratic transition in 2000, Mexicos old ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party had a longstanding policy of opposing U.S. interference in Cuba, in part because Mexico feared outside criticism of its own less-than-democratic regime. Lorena Ruano, a professor at Mexicos Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said Mexicos policy was ""to defend the sovereignty of other countries, so that 'others wont criticize me."" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is a fervent believer in that old policy, and last week he called Cuba an ""example of resistance"" and proposed that the entire country be declared a World Heritage site. While much of Cuba seems stuck technologically in the middle of the last century, Lopez Obrador did not appear to be speaking ironically when he proposed the world heritage designation, which is usually used by the United Nations to honor historical sites. Lopez Obrador praised Cubas ability to stand up to U.S. hostility since 1959, but did not mention recent street protests that were violently repressed by the Cuban government. Lopez Obrador has in the past stated his opposition to U.S. sanctions that limit commerce with the island, and said they should be ended. On Thursday, the U.S. government tightened the sanctions on some Cuban officials over the suppression of the rare street protests earlier this month. The new sanctions target a Cuban official and a government special brigade that the United States says was involved in human rights abuses during the government crackdown.",

The more recent deaths come in the wake of massive protests in the Communist country earlier this month, with thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to demand freedom, food, and medications -- including COVID vaccines. The global pandemic has spiked in the past month, with new daily cases jumping from 1,880 on June 24 to 7,732 one month later. Overall, Cuba has had more than 340,000 coronavirus cases and 2,417 deaths since the outbreak of the deadly virus last year, WPLG said. Cuban government officials have not said if the recent deaths of the five military leaders were linked to the virus. -",
Cuba: Minor Arrested at Protests Says Police Threatened to Rape Her,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/28/cuba-minor-arrested-witnessing-protests-says-police-threatened-rape-her/,07/28/21,www.breitbart.com,"A 17-year-old girl sentenced to eight months of house arrest for having witnessed protests in Cuba on July 11 told the independent outlet Cubanet in an interview this week that police forced her to strip naked and threatened to subject her to rape by two large men. Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez was on her way back home from the hairdresser in her native Havana when she noticed what she described as the largest crowd of people she had ever seen in her life. On July 11, Cubans nationwide took to the streets of nearly every major city in the country demanding an end to the communist regime. The protests reportedly attracted thousands of people, the vast majority marching peacefully through main streets and into central plazas calling for the communist regime to step down, and represented the largest nationwide simultaneous protest in recent memory. Police arrested Zequeira and branded her a ""counterrevolutionary"" for being near the vicinity of protests. Zequeira -- and her mother, who insisted for days during her daughters arrest that the girl did not intend to participate -- said she attempted to explain to police repeatedly that she did not even know what the assembly she was viewing was for. She also repeatedly told police she was underaged, she asserted, but was told she was only technically underage ""for some things,"" without elaborating. Zequeiras mother did not know of her whereabouts between Sunday, July 11, and that Tuesday. Police initially sentenced Zequeira to eight months in prison for ""public disorder"" but reduced the sentence to house arrest following international condemnation for the violation of human rights that her case represents. Zequeira recounted her experience to Cubanet, pausing on some occasions to express shame at describing the comments police made to her and crying when remembering the first moment she saw her mother again after being arrested. ""When I was on the way back from the hairdresser home ... I got so surprised; Im 17 and Id never seen a protest so big, such a big crowd of people ... the officials got me,"" Zequeira explained. ""They assaulted me, they grabbed my arm, manhandling me; they stuffed me in the police car like I was anything. I asked them in the car, 'Why am I here? Im 17.'"" ""They told me, 'This is so you know you cant be protesting against YOUR revolution. You are a counterrevolutionary,'"" she recalled. Once sent to a jail cell, an official told her, the girl relayed, that her mother was at the station. At the time, Zequeira noted, police had not notified her mother of the arrest and she was not present at the police station. ""A woman officer told me, 'Your mother is waiting for you here -- which my mother didnt even know -- your mother is waiting for you here, which I cried from how impotent I felt -- 'Your mother is waiting for you here with a stick to beat you for being such a counterrevolutionary.'"" Police told her the next morning to pack her things and prepare to go home, as she was being released. This, too, Zequeria said, was a lie: police instead bussed her to 100 y Aldabo, one of Havanas most notorious prisons. The facility has for decades had a reputation of being a central hub of torture and abuse of anti-communist dissidents. ""They took me to the dressing room and told me 'take your clothes off, take your shirt off,'"" Zequeira explained. ""They searched my bra looking for wires. I dont know why they had to do that. I kept telling them I was a minor ... and they didnt listen."" ""Then they told me 'take off your shorts and your panties,'"" she continued. ""I took off my shorts and underwear, and there they told me to cough, to squat and squeeze the lower part of my torso. They told me to stick my finger inside me to see if I was carrying anything. I told them I was a minor; they couldnt do that."" ""They told me, 'youre a minor for some things, but not others. Right now, you are of age,'"" Zequeria said. The teen girl added that, while in her prison cell, officials came into her cell and threatened to have two men rape her. She noted that they told her they would send her ""to the pavilion,"" which she assumed meant they would beat and torture her, but relatives explained when she recounted the story at home that the prison slang term actually refers to ""sexual relations."" ""One of the most unpleasant moments I had ... they came into my cell and said they were going to get a guy named 'Hose and a guy named 'Sledgehammer and take me out to the 'pavilion,'"" Zequeira told Cubanet, expressing clear embarrassment while retelling the story. ""That 'Hose was a mulatto guy, strong, with a not that big ... thing but more or less. And Sledgehammer was a black man, strong, very big, who did have it big. He told me laughing."" ""They just explained to me now that I got out that 'pavilion is to go have sexual relations,"" she said. Zequeira emphasized that, while she did not initially intend to protest, she now supported the movement against the regime. ""I want to send a message to all these minors, all these women, the mothers, too, like mine: keep struggling ... the mothers, keep struggling so that they free all these women that have nothing to do with this,"" she said. ""Its an injustice -- even if you had done it [protested] -- it feels like in the entire world there is freedom of expression and everything you say is respected. Here, it is not respected."" At press time, international human rights groups have documented at least 740 people nationwide missing or in police custody for protesting since July 11. Experts on human rights in Cuba caution that the number is likely significantly smaller than the true toll and that thousands may be missing or imprisoned, many unreachable from abroad because of the large number of protests against the regime in the remote interior of the country. Among them, international groups have confirmed at least a dozen cases of imprisoned minors. Foreign Ministry Bruno Rodriguez initially denied that police had arrested any children during the protests last week, but his remarks occurred after Attorney General Yamila Pena had already told reporters, ""there have been some minors; it is under investigation.""

Five Cuban generals dead in recent days - is the Covid spike to blame?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/cuba-generals-deaths-covid-19-coronavirus,07/28/21,www.theguardian.com,"Five mostly elderly and retired Cuban military generals have died in recent days in mysterious circumstances, the countrys communist regime has confirmed, adding intrigue to a new round of freedom protests taking place in the island and US. There is no suggestion of foul play in the deaths of the five, one of whom was the former head of Cubas air force when it shot down two American private planes in the infamous 1996 Brothers to the Rescue outrage. But with Covid-19 surging across the island, and the average number of daily new cases in Cuba close to 8,000, almost eight times higher than the beginning of July, observers fear that the pandemic could be responsible. The youngest of the generals was 57. Cubas government has not given an explanation or cause of death for any of the five. According to the Miami Herald, which first reported the story, the deaths came within days of anti-government protests across Cuba, the largest show of public dissent against the regime in decades. The demise of the generals also caught the attention of Floridas senior senator Marco Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Cuba in the 1950s, before Fidel Castros 1959 communist revolution. ""Nine days. Five dead generals in #Cuba. Very strange,"" he tweeted on Tuesday, following up an earlier tweet in which he noted that high-ranking military officials ""have had some incredibly bad luck recently"". Rubio has been one of the most vocal politicians against the Cuban government in Florida, home to more than 1.5m exiles and first and second-generation Cuban-Americans, and has joined recent protests in Miamis Little Havana neighborhood. The best-known of the five is Ruben Martinez Puente, 79, a former chief of the Cuban air force who was indicted in Miami in 2003 but never faced trial for the incident seven years earlier in which two pilots and two other passengers were killed when a Cuban military jet shot down their Cessna planes in international waters. Martinez Puente died on 24 July, the Herald reported, citing a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba memorandum. The others, the newspaper said, included Agustin Pena Porrez, a former head of Cubas eastern army, who died on 17 July at the age of 57. It said the communist party newspaper Granma published pictures of his funeral and quoted a tweet by Cuban leader Miguel Diaz-Canel saying the death was ""sad news."" Marcelo Verdecia, a retired brigadier general and former Castro bodyguard, died 20 July in Santa Clara. Retired brigadier general Eduardo Lastres Pacheco died on Monday this week, and on Tuesday the Twitter account of the university of Las Villas reported the death of retired brigadier general Armando Choy Rodriguez, 87. No ages were given for Verdecia or Lastres Pacheco.",
'Terror': Crackdown After Protests in Cuba Sends a Chilling Message,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/world/americas/cuba-protests-crackdown-arrests.html,07/28/21,www.nytimes.com,"The courage many Cubans showed when they poured into the streets two weeks ago -- chanting ""Down with the dictatorship!"" and ""We are not afraid!"" -- has curdled into fear for many. Hundreds have been detained, advocates say, and an untold number are still being held. The police have staked out the homes of activists. And among government critics, there is a widespread sense that the crackdown is far from over. Maykel Gonzalez, an independent journalist taken into custody after the July 11 protests, has ventured out of his home rarely in recent days, frightened by the surveillance and harassment that other protesters are enduring. ""At any moment they could show up at my door,"" said Mr. Gonzalez, 37. ""Its a fear thats with me from the moment I wake up.""",
'Biden Asleep and Clueless': Demonstrators Demand Internet For Cuba,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/28/demonstrators-lawmakers-demand-internet-for-cuba-biden-asleep-and-clueless/,07/28/21,www.breitbart.com,"Protesters gathering in support of human rights in Cuba in Washington, DC, lamented that President Joe Biden has taken little to no action after thousands-strong protests rocked the communist nation on July 11. Cuban-Americans, joined by human rights activists and members of Congress, gathered at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday and called on the Biden Administration to act in the face of brutal communist repression following the July 11 protests. Activists and Republican lawmakers spoke at the protest, expressing solidarity and laying out goals they hope to see the president fulfill, including restoring internet access to the island. The Castro regime has blocked access to the internet since videos of peaceful protests - and violent attacks on protesters - began circulating this month. ""Whats the very first thing that brutal dictators around the world do as soon as people start to see whats taking place inside their regimes? They shut down connectivity. They block access to the internet because the thing that they hate the most is the spotlight of the world seeing what they are doing,"" said Brendan Carr, senior Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Rep. Maria Salazar (R-FL), a Cuban-American who represented a heavily Cuban-American district in Florida, claimed that protests in Cuba began because of a post on social media. ""Why is [restoring internet] so important? Because of everything on July 11 started because someone in a remote town in Cuba was doing a Facebook live, and then the rest of the island saw it -- and then it spread like wildfire,"" Salazar said. Watch: Exclusive Interview with Rep. Salazar: ""This Is the Beginning of the End"" for Cubas Communist Regime Biden has been under mounting pressure from human rights groups to assist protesters against Cubas violent regime. Since protests began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten protesters in the streets. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, the regime shut down nationwide access to the internet and ordered door-to-door raids of homes in the cities that had the largest protest turnout. The White House has discussed providing internet to Cuba but, two weeks later, Biden has not yet approved a plan. ""We have the technological capability to support internet connectivity for the people of Cuba. We can stand with them. We can beam in new internet services from off-island,"" Carr said. ""We can support circumvention tools that allow the people of Cuba to get around the blocking and the filtering of the internet and connections that exist right there."" ""Weve done this before around the globe. This is not a technological challenge. This is a political challenge,"" Carr continued. ""Will the Biden Administration stand for freedom? ... Its been two weeks and I hope we get there."" When speaking to the crowd, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said, ""time is of the essence"" and said he does not ""understand what it takes to make Biden move."" Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R) agreed when he spoke, asking ""where is this guy?"" in reference to Biden. Watch: Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Needs to Get Rid of ""Illegitimate"" Cuban Embassy in D.C. ""Call it socialism, call it communism -- it will fall because of the heroism of the Cuban people. It will fall because the American people understand freedom. It will fall, despite a president that is totally asleep and clueless,"" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) joined in. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki initially attempted to claim that protesters in Cuba were objecting to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, not 62 years of violent communism, before finally condemning communism as a ""failed ideology"" several days later. Biden, too, took several days to explicitly condemn communism and failed to mention public beatings and other brutalities perpetrated by the Cuban regime. He has since sanctioned only one Cuban official - already under sanctions thanks to the administration of President Donald Trump and with no known U.S. assets - and held a Zoom call with Cuban-American celebrities to gather ""advice"" on potential policy changes. ""My question for president Biden is, are you with the dictators of Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, China -- or are you with the American people who want freedom and the Cuban people who dying for freedom, literally as we speak,"" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) said. Watch: GOP Rep., Daughter of Cuban Refugee Asks Biden: Are You with Dictators? Marta Ferrer, the daughter of Cuban human rights activist Jose Daniel Ferrer, also spoke at the event, telling the crowd in Spanish that, as of Tuesday, her father has been missing for 17 days. The elder Ferrer is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), the countrys largest dissident organization. He most recently disappeared in October 2019 after organizing nationwide protests corresponding to the feast day of Cubas patron saint, Our Lady of Charity, only to resurface with clear signs of torture six months later. The younger Ferrer said of the protesters: [My dad] and hundreds of Cubans who went out to demand freedom for Cuba and an end to the tyranny in Cuba. Today, we dont know anything of him or the other hundreds of Cubans. We dont know if they are torturing them, which is the likeliest thing. We dont know if he is alive because they dont give him a phone call, no visits, they dont give us any proof of him and all the families in Cuba who now have missing relatives today ... Today I am here supporting you all and expressing solidarity with all the families and demanding that the dictatorship give proof of life for all the disappeared, of my father, that the repression end in Cuba, that they stop killing innocents, imprisoning innocents going out on the street to demand an end to the tyranny and demand the freedom that 62 years ago, the dictatorship stole from them.

"Rep. Salazar: ""This Is the Beginning of the End"" for Communism in Cuba",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/28/rep-maria-salazar-beginning-end-cuba-communist-regime/,07/29/21,www.breitbart.com,"Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) told Breitbart News in an interview Wednesday that she believes protests beginning on July 11 in Cuba are ""the beginning of the end"" for communism there. ""There is no turning back. After 62 years of a repressive apparatus that has been extremely effective, people lose everything: their homes, their families, their health, their education, because Cuba is a completely failed state,"" Salazar said. ""But now they have lost fear, which is the last thing that you lose in a communist regime -- and Cubans lost it."" Salazar was referencing island-wide anti-government protests that erupted across Cuba on July 11. A demonstrator reportedly streamed a protest on Facebook, which then went viral and enabled Cubans in other parts of the country to participate in what became the largest anti-government protest on the island in decades. Since protests began, police have opened fire on crowds and beaten protesters in the streets. In the immediate aftermath of the protests, the regime shut down nationwide access to the internet and ordered door-to-door raids of homes in the cities that had the largest protest turnout. Salazar, who represents the city of Miami -- or, as she calls it, ""the heart of the Cuban exile community"" in the U.S. -- said liberation in Cuba could become a reality much sooner if the Biden administration would intervene. ""The immediate ask is connectivity and leadership. That doesnt cost money. You dont have to go through Congress. You only need to prove to the world that you are really who you say you are -- the top diplomat and somebody that loves freedom,"" she said, addressing President Joe Biden. Brendan Carr, senior Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), told Breitbart News Sunday host Joel Pollak that U.S. firms can provide internet access to Cuba and circumvent the digital blockade imposed on the one-party island state. Breitbart News reported: ""We have the technical capability to circumvent that Internet blockade [in Cuba], and theres two ways we can do it,"" Carr told Pollak. ""One, we can introduce new Internet connections and services from off-island that can connect directly to the smartphones of the people that are right there in Cuba. Thats path one."" He continued, ""Path two is we need to further bolster the technology that allows Cubans to circumvent the blockade on their own infrastructure. So we need to do both of those, and we can do both of those. Its simply a question of 'Do we have the political will in the Biden administration to give the green light thats necessary for American enterprises to engage in those activities?"" ""The only actual question that matters is [related to] political will,"" he emphasized. ""Do we have the political will to do this? If we do, then the technological issue is not in the way."" The Biden administration publicly said it is considering providing internet to the people of Cuba, though it has taken no action in two weeks. ""If you turn on the wifi, the Cubans will know that they are not alone. They will start communicating among themselves once again, and then they will decide if they want to go back into the streets or not,"" Salazar said. ""Its up to them because thats how everything started on July 11."" On leadership, Salazar said Biden needs to rally the international community to condemn Cubas dictatorship. She also said Biden has the opportunity to ""redress the historical mistake called the 'Bay of Pigs,""' the massacre of dozens of Cuban exiles in April 1961 prompted by President John F. Kennedy promising and not delivering air support to a military invasion against the communist regime, planned -- thanks to Kennedy -- in such a way in which succeeding without air support was impossible. Exiles who did not escape by sea were rounded up and either killed or imprisoned by Castros forces. Kennedys betrayal has largely been blamed for helping to solidify Castros communist regime on the island. ""And look, I am a Republican, but it doesnt matter. We need help from everyone else. This has nothing to do with political parties,"" she said. ""This has to do with a group of Americans helping a group of Cubans that want to have what we have: freedom, civil rights, free market economy, and democracy."" The congresswoman also warned of Americans falling prey to the false promises of socialism and noted Cubans are frustrated because they know ""how bad socialism and how bad communism can be."" ""Thats why were fighting. Thats why I won. Because we know that this Democratic socialism dream that some of my colleagues on the Democratic side are selling -- its a farce. Its not true. It may be noble in theory, but its miserable in practice,"" she said.",
"After historic protests, defiant Cubans face mass trials",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/29/americas/cuba-protests-mass-trials-cmd-intl/index.html,07/29/21,www.cnn.com,"Havana, Cuba (CNN) Following the most widespread protests since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cubans are now bracing themselves for a new aftershock poised to shake the communist-run island: Mass trials of those who dared to take to the streets calling for change. Fewer than three weeks since the beginning of the unprecedented anti-government demonstrations, the trials are already underway. Not surprisingly, those proceedings are leading to swift convictions. Thousands of Cubans have taken part in rare protests against the communist government, marching and chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty."" Photographer Anyelo Troya said he was running errands when thousands of Cubans streamed into the streets of Havana this month, many chanting ""liberty"" and ""homeland and life,"" a reference to a viral anti-government song . Troya, who had already drawn the ire of Cuban officials for filming part of the music video for that searing opposition anthem, rushed to the protests carrying his camera. ""He was arrested immediately,"" his mother Raisa Gonzalez told CNN. ""He didn't even get a chance to take a photo."" The following week, Troya was put on trial with a dozen other protesters and convicted of instigating unrest. At his sentencing, where he was given a year in prison, Troya's mother said he asked to address the judges. His mother said he told the court he did nothing wrong, asking, ""How is this just when I haven't even seen a lawyer and I am innocent?"" Raisa Gonzalez added, ""Immediately one of the police in civilian clothes came and handcuffed him. I said, 'My love be calm, you are not alone.'"" Cuban officials have refused to say how many people were arrested following the island-wide protests, which came as the Cuban government struggles to deal with increasing shortages of basic goods and surging coronavirus cases. According to the exile group Cubalex which has tracked the arrests, as of July 26, nearly 700 Cubans have been detained since the protests started. Cuban officials have said some protesters who were arrested are being released. Cubalex puts the number of those released at 157. The families of some protesters, who did not want to be identified, told CNN their relatives were arrested merely for being in the street while the protests took place or simply for filming the demonstrations. Many young people in Cuba had not seen protests on such a scale in their lifetime. Stung by criticism that its crackdown on protesters shows a glaring disregard for basic civil liberties, Cuban officials said due process was being followed and that some demonstrators had destroyed property and attacked police. ""Having different opinions, including political ones, doesn't constitute a crime,"" said Ruben Remigio Ferro, the president of the Supreme People's Court of Cuba, at a press conference. ""Thinking differently, questioning what's going on. To demonstrate is not a crime, it's a right granted by the constitution...We are not troglodytes."" But in practice, officials treat any calls for change to the Communist monopoly on power in Cuba -- where opposition parties are outlawed -- as an existential threat. Anti-government protests have gained momentum through the growth of mobile internet in Cuba. The rapid growth of mobile internet in Cuba has opened the way for Cubans to quickly organize and share images of protests. Activists in recent years have tried to hold demonstrations protesting artistic censorship; in favor of LGBTQ rights; and demanding a law banning animal cruelty. But Cuban police, plainclothes state security and baton-toting 'rapid response brigades' have quickly shut down those rare displays of defiance. Only when thousands took to the streets in July did Cuba's security apparatus seem briefly overwhelmed. Cuban officials justified the crackdown on protesters by saying the demonstrations had been fomented by Cuba's Cold War nemesis, the United States. ""When you try to do a movement organized from abroad and aim at trying to create the kind of situation the United States government will use as justification for greater aggression against Cuba, that naturally is not allowed,"" Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, the head of US affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told CNN. ""That can put in jeopardy the national security of our country."" Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the US government for unprecedented protests across the island. Cuban artists, writers and musicians have decried the arrests and called for an amnesty for non-violent protesters. Facing heavy criticism, the government, in at least a few cases, appears to be backtracking. Following his conviction, Anyelo Troya was released under home arrest while he pursues an appeal. ""I should be 100% free,"" Troya wrote to CNN in a message. Others may not be so lucky. When protesters took to the streets on July 11 in the working-class neighborhood of La Guinera, homemaker Odet Hernandez Cruzata and her husband Reinier Reinosa Cabrera, who before the pandemic worked in nightclubs, joined in, according to their relatives in Cuba and abroad. Odet streamed the protests live on Facebook. In her 22-minute-long video, the crowd can be heard yelling ""homeland and life"" and ""a people united cannot be defeated!"" But as the crowd approaches what they say is a police station, people cry out that shots are being fired at them and to take cover. The Cuban government later said one protester was killed in the neighborhood by officials, who claim the demonstrator attempted to attack them. According to their relatives, Odet and Reinier protested peacefully and returned home. ""They weren't violent, they didn't throw rocks at anyone,"" said Odet's cousin Angelo Padron, who lives in France but has kept in close touch with relatives on the island. ""They didn't commit any violence. Then special troops came to get them at their home. A commando unit with many police."" Padron said the couple is now under arrest and facing serious charges including assault, disorderly conduct, damage to public property and instigation. CNN has not been able to independently verify the charges. Relatives are trying to find the couple a lawyer while they take care of Odet's five-year-old daughter, Padron said. Neither had any prior arrests, he added. While their family assert the couple do not seem to present much of a threat, the Cuban government appears increasingly wary of newly tech-savvy and defiant Cubans. Perhaps because, so far, the video of the protest that Odet live-streamed to Facebook has received more than 124,000 views.",
Trump's inroads with Florida Latinos are influencing Democratic response to Cuba,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/29/politics/biden-cuba-florida-politics/index.html,07/29/21,www.cnn.com,"(CNN) Democrats in South Florida, beleaguered by a tough 2020 election in the state, have been privately and publicly urging their party leaders to embrace the protests against Cuba's communist regime that are roiling the island nation. Their reasoning is as much personal -- these Democrats believe supporting the protests is the right thing to do -- as it is political -- standing with the Cuban people could help the party regain ground with the state's diverse Hispanic voters, nearly half of whom voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 in a nearly 10-point swing from four years before. Annette Taddeo, a Democratic state senator from Miami-Dade County, has called on President Joe Biden to visit Miami to show solidarity with the rare demonstrations in Cuba, which have brought thousands into the streets calling for freedom, better economic conditions, internet access and an end to the dictatorship. An appearance by the Democratic President, Taddeo told CNN, would go a long way with Cuban American and other Latino voters in South Florida. ""The politics come with being there,"" she said. Florida has long been one of the most prized states in politics, gaining outsized influence because of its size, diversity and the way it swung between Democrats and Republicans for years. In recent years, however, the state has tilted right, backing Trump in 2016 and 2020. Republican inroads Taddeo, a Colombian immigrant, says she has been in touch with officials in the White House and has held public events on the Cuban protests with other prominent South Florida Democrats, such as Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Despite hopes and even expectations that Biden would replicate former President Barack Obama's foreign policy on Cuba -- normalizing and expanding diplomatic relations, relaxing decades-old travel and trade restrictions -- he has yet to fulfil his campaign promises to roll back the Trump administration's Cuba sanctions or open up relations again. Indeed, six months into Biden's presidency, the White House has yet to complete its review on Cuba polic y. In large part, that's because of Florida politics and a growing concern among Democrats that the inroads Republican made in South Florida in the 2020 election will become an even bigger issue in the coming years -- particularly as the state is set to gain another seat in the House of Representatives after the 2020 census. Asked how much Florida politics are shaping the Biden administration's Cuba policy, administration officials sidestepped the question but stressed their interest in the welfare and freedoms of the Cuban people as well as in increasing US Embassy staffing on the island to better engage with Cuban civil society amid the unprecedented protests It's unclear where the administration's official policy on Cuba will land. But Democrats in Washington are getting the message from South Florida and are emphasizing how tough the administration has been in response to the protests. The Democratic National Committee launched targeted English- and Spanish-language digital ads this week in the Sunshine State that highlight Biden's recent punitive actions against the Cuban government. ""We have a huge opportunity here with a President who is more forceful on Cuba where many Democratic presidents in recent memory may not have been as forceful,"" a senior Democrat said of Biden's response to the Cuban crackdowns. ""There is some real opportunity here. We have something very concrete that, across the ideologic spectrum -- save maybe the farthest of the far left -- is supported."" The Democrat added that many in the party's leadership believe Trump's dominance in South Florida was ""more of an aberration than some sort of liner trajectory for how Democrats can perform in South Florida."" This push from South Florida Democrats like Taddeo reflects how the party is looking for ways to break the GOP's hold on the closely split state. In 2020, Republicans made significant inroads with an array of Latino voters in South Florida, including Cubans, Colombians and Venezuelans. The increase was so significant that Trump was able to become the first Republican presidential candidate since 1976 to lose Duval County in North Florida -- a longtime Republican bastion -- and still win the state by more than 3 percentage points. During the campaign, Republicans portrayed Democrats as soft on communist regimes, emphasizing how Trump had reversed much of the ""thaw"" in US-Cuba relations during Obama's second term. The GOP messaging worked, particularly after Biden said two months before the election that he would roll back Trump's sanctions on Cuba. Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida International University, said foreign policy on Cuba has outsized resonance with Florida Latinos, even among the growing non-Cuban Hispanic communities. ""Florida has a very heterogenous Latino population but one of the things that hold them in common ... is a lot of them are fleeing left-wing governments,"" Moreno said. ""Trump cultivated that concern [about Cuba] in South Florida, not only with Cubans but with Colombians and Venezuelans and Nicaraguans."" 'Florida politics is international politics' Even with the direct Biden response, Florida Democrats have a growing sense of dread that the dent Republicans have made in South Florida could become an even bigger issue in the coming years. ""It works,"" Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a veteran Florida Democratic strategist and Colombian American, said about the Republican strategy. ""Sadly enough, we have seen this work in the past with what Trump did with Latino communities. ... From the Democrats that I have talked to, there is a serious concern."" Perez-Verdia said Floridians from the Latino diaspora ""look at everything through the lens of the politics of their country,"" meaning ""Florida politics is international politics"" as much as it is domestic. Democrats are attempting to respond with plans to address US policy toward the island nation, as well as with forceful statements about the democracy movements there. Earlier this month, the Biden administration sanctioned a key Cuban official and a Cuban special forces unit known as the Boinas Negras for human rights abuses in the wake of protests. Biden said sanctions were ""just the beginning,"" pledging that ""the United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people."" The President went on to ""condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are unjustly sentencing to prison those who dared to speak out in an effort to intimidate and threaten the Cuban people into silence."" The DNC's geo-targeted Facebook ads in both English and Spanish highlighted Biden's stance on Cuba and his pledge for more sanctions. Multiple iterations of the ad highlighted Biden saying that communism is a ""failed system."" ""The DNC is committed to using our resources to speak directly to the Cuban community in South Florida to make sure they know that President Biden and Democrats have their back,"" said Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic committee. Politics is unavoidable Asked directly if domestic politics surrounding Florida were playing a role in US foreign policy on Cuba, a senior State Department official said, ""Our focus right now is on the people on the island, making demands of their government for change."" ""We are very interested in the voice of the Cuban people being able to be heard and have expressed concerns about efforts to curtail internet freedom and in communication,"" the official said. ""It is clear that the protests were a result of the Cuban people's exhaustion with the inability of their government to meet their demands and were spontaneous and honest calls for change,"" the official said. ""That really is the key focus of our efforts right now -- determining the best way to support the Cuban people and to hold the government accountable for its actions."" Cuba watchers like John Kavulich, president of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, say domestic politics will always play a role in Cuba -- particularly with Florida set to gain another electoral seat after the latest census. ""US politicians focus on politics, so why is anyone shocked when any politician -- whether it's President Biden, President Trump, President Obama, the first President Bush -- sees it that way? A politician is going to take into account what the constituents want. Cuba is a domestic political issue,"" Kavulich said. ""When people say that the Biden admin should be strong and remove Florida from the Cuba policy decision-making process, it's foolishness. It's not going to happen. The fact that Florida is picking up a seat in the House of Representatives makes it even more important for both political parties,"" Kavulich added.",
"Cuba Responds to Protests: More Rice Rations, No Extra Freedom",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/29/cuba-responds-protests-3-extra-pounds-rice-rations-no-extra-freedom/,07/29/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Ministry of Interior Commerce in Cuba announced Wednesday that it would increase rice rations by an extra three pounds per person per month, an attempt to quell the eruption of anti-communist unrest that has persisted since July 11. That day, thousands of Cubans nationwide -- in nearly every city on the island -- organized peaceful marches calling for the end of the communist Castro regime, which has used executions, torture, and imprisonment to stay in power since 1959. The scope of the protests attracted international attention and has triggered ongoing protests by Cubans in the diaspora in major capitals around the world, most prominently in Washington, D.C. The protesters chanted slogans like ""freedom"" and anti-communist phrases, plainly stating opposition to the regime. The Communist Party of Cuba has attributed the protests to alleged illicit American intelligence activity, without providing any evidence for U.S. involvement, while international leftist groups sympathetic to the regime have claimed the protesters were objecting to an increasingly dire economic situation in the country that they, too, blamed on the United States. The administration of President Joe Biden adopted the false claim that the protesters were objecting to a deteriorating Chinese coronavirus situation. Attempting to fuel the narrative that the protesters were demanding an improved economic situation, the Ministry of Interior Commerce (MINCIN) announced a giveaway of a paltry three extra pounds of rice per person every month from August to December. Minister Betsy Diaz Velazquez said at a press conference that the extra food rations were in part possible due to humanitarian aid from Russia and Nicaragua, allied leftist regimes. Diaz explicitly connected the rations to the protests, stating the government sought ""in this way to begin giving the population a level of satisfaction at a time in which the imperialism [the United States] is trying to create irritation and disgust among our people and has a high responsibility in what is happening."" !!ULTIMO MINUTO!! Incrementar la oferta de alimentos es una prioridad para el gobierno, muestra de ello es que se entregaran3libras de arroz adicionales mensualmente por persona, garantizadas hasta diciembre, a partir de los ingresos obtenidos por las ventas en MLC. Abrimos hilo pic.twitter.com/N5BELuXvaZ -- Comercio Cuba (@MincinCuba) July 28, 2021 As a communist country, the Cuban Communist Country controls and distributes the nations food supply. Citizens receive ration cards that specify how much food each individual can purchase; it is illegal for individuals to independently decide how much food they need for their homes. Diaz also noted that families would have access to their August food rations early, according to the official newspaper of the Communist Party, Granma. The newspaper added that Diaz announced that it had received extra ""prime materials, like wheat flour, whose destination will be, fundamentally, towards local production industries to increase the output of bread and crackers."" The announcement did not specify any provisions of extra protein other than powdered milk for senior citizens and beans for four different provinces. The independent outlet Cubanet noted Wednesday that the general Cuban population met the announcement with outrage, noting it did nothing to address the core demand of the protesters that the communist regime leaves power. ""Every day they remind me more of Orwells 1984 with this increase by three pounds of the rice [ration] as if that represented the liberty and human rights that the people want, useless bunch of people,"" one social media user highlighted by Cubanet lamented. Diaz, the minister of interior commerce, has been one of the least popular members of the Communist Party leadership for years. Diaz outraged the general population in 2019 in an interview on state television attempting to address shortages created by poor management of food industries by the Party, particularly a shortage of flour that resulted from the government failing to repair aging wheat mills. The government blamed then-President Donald Trump for the shortages, without explaining what role he would have had in the mechanical failures, and cut rations for the majority of citizens. Diaz said on national television that, in addition to the United States, Cuban citizens themselves were responsible for shortages due to hoarding, adding most Cubans supporting receiving less food through the ration system. ""There are a variety of different opinions, most consider these [rations] good and even insist on us continuing to ration products,"" she alleged, prompting widespread indignation. The Castro regime has not supplemented its meager increase in rice rations with any reduction in human rights violations or restoration of basic freedoms for the Cuban people at press time. Following the protests, the regime enacted mass arrests and ordered state security officials to conduct violent door-to-door raids against suspected protesters. Those arrested, human rights groups have alleged, are being subjected to summary judgment trials with no significant due process safeguards. Police have denied the accused in many cases knowledge of what crime they are facing a trial for and access to an attorney. Those sentenced have said they have faced ""summary trials"" alongside as many as 30 other people and sentenced simultaneously. Those outside of prison have accused police of openly threatening them, including children erroneously arrested despite playing no role in the protests. Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez, a 17-year-old sentenced to eight months of house arrest for having witnessed protests she did not participate in, told Cubanet this week -- shortly after her release from one of Cubas most notorious prisons -- that police officers threatened to trap her in a room with two large men who would rape her. She was also subject to a strip search and forced to digitally penetrate herself while squatting in front of guards, allegedly to ensure she was not hiding a weapon. The parents of Yoel Misael Fuentes Garcia, a 16-year-old, told independent outlets last week that police visited the boy in the hospital to threaten him after police shot him on July 11. Fuentes was also not participating in the protests, merely peeking out of his home out of curiosity after hearing the tumult of the crowd. ""We, the relatives, had to see Yoelito through a glass in the hospital. Meanwhile, a police officer went directly to his bed to interrogate and coerce him,"" his stepfather told Diario de Cuba. ""He told him that they could take him to 100 y Aldabo."" 100 y Aldabo is one of Cubas most violent political prisoners and where Zequeira experienced her sexual assault and threats.

Summary trials have begun for those detained in unprecedented protests nationwide over shortages, power outages and a lack of freedoms on July 11, amid a deep economic crisis that has been exacerbated by the pandemic and U.S. sanctions. Rights groups have reported around 700 people detained, including several minors.

It came three days after the foreign ministers of the United States and 20 other countries including a handful of EU member states condemned the mass arrests. ""We urge (the government) to release all arbitrarily detained protesters, to listen to the voices of its citizens, and to engage in an inclusive dialogue on their grievances,"" Borrell said. The EU has avoided public confrontation with Cuba over human rights issues ever since in 2016 signing a new agreement to normalize relations that no longer sought to coerce the Communist-run Caribbean island into democratic reform. The deal was part of a broader Cuban detente with the West. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter he ""strongly rejected"" the EU statement, which he criticized for not mentioning the ""genocidal U.S. blockade"" for which the government largely blames the country's hardships. Some of Havana's allies like Mexico and Russia have reacted to the protests by denouncing the U.S. trade embargo, and the Organization of American States had to postpone a special meeting on Cuba due to disagreement among member states over its treatment of the matter.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) MEXICO CITY (AP) -- U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with Cuban-American leaders Friday to discuss the recent social protests in Cuba, the possibility of new sanctions on its government and options for providing internet access to the islands population. The afternoon White House meeting, previewed for The Associated Press by an administration official, will take place almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest the shortage of products, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. Among the people who will meet with Biden is Yotuel Romero, one of the authors of the song ""Patria y vida!"" which has become a kind of anthem for the protests, said the official, who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans in public. ADVERTISEMENT Also present will be L. Felice Gorordo, CEO of the company eMerge Americas; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project, and Miamis former mayor, Manny Diaz, among others. The White House did not provide more details, only saying that new sanctions will be discussed as well as ways to establish internet access for the Cuban people. Internet access is a sensitive issue in Cuba. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls for antigovernment demonstrations on social media. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did so. Some U.S. leaders, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have said the White House should do something to maintain internet service in Cuba, including using balloons as Wi-Fi access points for the population. Jose Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watchs director for the Americas, said protecting internet access in Cuba ""must be one of the top priorities"" of the Biden administration. ""The growing access to the internet on the island has been a true revolution that has allowed the population to communicate, organize protests and report abuses almost immediately - something that would have been impossible a few years ago,"" he said to the AP. Regarding the sanctions, Vivanco said their value is ""mostly symbolic,"" because it is not realistic to think that they alone will change the situation on the island. He said one way to stop human rights violations in Cuba is a ""multilateral and coordinated condemnation,"" along with moving toward a policy that puts an end to the current embargo. In addition to the internet, the Biden administration is considering proposals put forward by U.S. advocates of trade with Cuba that would restore ways for Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives on the island. Biden and others have rejected the outright restoration of remittances because of a percentage fee of the transaction paid to the government. But under one proposal being considered, the transfer agents would waive that fee until the end of the year, according to proponents. The proposal would have to be cleared by the Cuban government, however, and it is not at all clear it would agree. Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the Minister of the Cuban Armed Forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""black berets"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. So far it is unclear how many people were detained in total, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people.",

"CNN accused of hypocrisy, 'pro-regime propaganda' for sounding alarm on Cuba COVID surge amid protests",https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-cuba-covid,07/30/21,www.foxnews.com,"CNN was accused of both hypocrisy and ""pro-regime propaganda"" on Thursday when the network sounded the alarm about a surge in COVID cases in Cuba following protests there. Observers pointed out CNN had downplayed the risk of COVID spread during Black Lives Matter demonstrations in America last summer. CNN reporter Patrick Oppmann reported that coronavirus cases and deaths have surged during recent anti-communism protests and pro-freedom demonstrations. ""I'm Patrick Oppmann in Havana, where COVID cases and deaths have surged here despite the Cuban government's claims that they've done a good job handling the pandemic. Certainly, it does not help that the historic protests and pro-government demonstrations have taken place over the last few weeks,"" he said on ""CNN Newsroom with Alisyn Camerota and Victor Blackwell."" CNN'S 'NEW DAY' FINISHES JULY DEAD LAST IN CABLE NEWS FROM 6 AM THROUGH MIDNIGHT AMONG KEY DEMO ""The government has actually arrested some protesters, saying that they violated covid protocols but then held their own large pro-government demonstrations to show that the support of the people is still with them,"" Oppmann continued. ""The government is vaccinating here with their own vaccines, but it will likely be weeks or months more before we see a dip in the COVID numbers."" Oppmanns report is a striking contrast to a June 2020 CNN article headlined, ""Black Lives Matter protests have not led to a spike in coronavirus cases, research says."" A media watchdog noticed an even larger issue. Media Research Center Latino director Jorge Bonilla wrote that Oppmann appeared to give the ""appearance of both-sidesing the report"" but a closer look reveals his true motive. FOX NEWS DOMINATES JULY RATINGS AS CNN CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE ""Take note of his presentation of the pro-regime protests, staged 'to show that the support of the people is still with them. Also, take note the juxtaposition of footage. On the SOS Cuba side, protesters were being arrested by regime forces in sparse settings. When discussing the regime's 'rallies, there was a tight shot depicting a large pro-regime crowd,"" Bonilla observed. ""Images are essential to storytelling, and it's hard to miss the subliminal story being told here. Taking that into consideration, the report was little more than pro-regime propaganda."" Bonilla aslo pointed out that ""you didnt hear of COVID concerns as Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. burned last summer"" because it didnt fit the liberal networks agenda. ""Remember that as the media scrambles to find villains for its Delta variant emergency panic coverage, and remember CNNs willingness to cover for the homicidal Castro regime,"" Bonilla wrote. CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNNS DON LEMON HAS LOWEST-RATED WEEK SINCE STRUGGLING PROGRAM SWITCHED NAMES ""Once again, your politics are defined by what youre willing to pause COVID for,"" author Antonio Garcia Martinez reacted.

"Reports: Joe Biden Invites Rapper, Former Food Blogger, Ex-Obama Staffer to Cuba Meeting",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/07/30/reports-joe-biden-invites-rapper-former-food-blogger-ex-obama-staffer-to-cuba-meeting/,07/30/21,www.breitbart.com,"The administration of President Joe Biden has invited a prominent Cuban rapper, a food blogger turned left-wing policy activist, and a former staffer for President Barack Obama to a meeting on Friday to discuss the ongoing repression of dissidents in Cuba. The White House previewed the guestlist for the event, scheduled for Friday afternoon, to the Associated Press on Thursday. The meeting followed a virtual discussion Biden hosted last week with Cuban-American celebrities Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia, among others, on the issue. ""The White House did not provide more details, only saying that new sanctions will be discussed as well as ways to establish internet access for the Cuban people,"" the AP reported. Protests erupted nationwide in Cuba on July 11 demanding an end to the Communist Partys rule of the island, which began in 1959. The protests consisted almost entirely of peaceful marches and assemblies in every major city of the country and featured attendees clearly chanting ""freedom!"" and other anti-communist slogans. The Castro regime responded to the protests with overwhelming violence, including opening fire on unarmed protesters, publicly beating individuals believed to be participating in protests, and allegedly torturing and sexually assaulting those imprisoned. Human rights activists and members of the Cuban exile community have urged Biden to take action against the regime through sanctions, weapons aid, or restoring internet access to Cuban users after the Castro regime shut it down. Republican lawmakers - many of them representing large Cuban-American populations - have also requested a meeting with the president to discuss moving forward with policies to aid the dissidents. Biden responded by organizing the Estefan Zoom meeting and sanctioning one Cuban official who predecessor Donald Trump had already sanctioned, a move panned as ""symbolic but meaningless."" Bidens meeting Friday will reportedly focus on restoring internet to the island to allow Cubans to share videos of police brutality and other real-time oppression by the Castro regime. At the top of the APs invite list is music artist Yotuel Romero, formerly of the rap group Orishas. Romero is one of several Cuban artists behind the hit single ""Patria y Vida,"" released this February as a protest anthem against the regime. The songs title, which translates to ""Fatherland and Life,"" is an inversion of the Communist Party slogan patria o muerte, meaning ""fatherland or death."" Patria y vida has become a rallying cry and representative slogan of the protest movement in Cuba and the diaspora. Prior to ""Patria y Vida,"" however, Yotuels former group was a darling of the Castro regime. Prior to 2021, the archives of Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, reveal a significant amount of positive coverage of both Romero and the Orishas, fueled by compliant interviews with the rapper himself. Speaking to Granma in 2016 about the Orishas reuniting that year for the first time in eight years, Romero said, ""We always had good relations with our country. For example, in this reunion we have had all the support of Cuban music institutions."" All Cuban artistic institutions are government-run, through the Ministry of Culture; Cuba made it illegal to write songs, draw, or film anything without a preemptive permit from the Ministry in 2019. Romero appeared to confirm his visit to Washington with a post on Instagram Thursday night. Also on the reported guest list for Bidens event is Ana Sofia Pelaez, the co-founder of the Miami Freedom Project, a liberal policy advocacy group. The project claims to advocate for climate change, immigration, and ""racial justice"" issues, all prominent left-wing policy issues and many not especially popular in the overwhelmingly Republican Cuban-American community. Prior to founding the group, Pelaez was most famous as a food writer, having launched her blog Hungry Sofia in 2008. The Associated Press also reported the presence of L. Felice Gorordo, a tech entrepreneur who worked on ""Latino, immigration, and business outreach"" in the Obama White House. Obama-era reports identify Gorordo as a vocal advocate for Obamas disastrous Cuba policy - largely consisting of economic concessions to dictator Raul Castro in the form of enhanced U.S. tourism to the island that resulted in astronomical numbers of politically motivated arrests and oppression on the island. The last name on the Associated Presss list is Manny Diaz, the former mayor of Miami now serving as the chair of the increasingly unpopular Florida Democratic Party. An outlier on the reported guess list, who the Associated Press did not name, is human rights activist Rosa Maria Paya of the Cuba Decide movement. Floridas WPLG Local 10 reported her expected presence at the meeting Friday. Paya, unlike most of the other names on the list, is one of the most prominent voices in the Cuban exile community against communism, organizing efforts in support of free and democratic efforts on the island and advocating for justice in the name of the victims of the regime. Payas father, Oswaldo Paya, founded the islands Christian Liberation Movement, an anti-communist group. The Castro regime is widely believed to have killed Paya and fellow activist Harold Cepero in a car ""accident"" in 2012. The White House has yet to confirm the reported guest list.

The Police Nacional Revolcionaria and the agencys director and deputy director, Oscar Callejas Valcarce and Eddie Sierra Arias, were targeted in the latest sanctions announced by the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. The police are part of Cubas interior ministry, which was already the subject of a blanket designation by the Trump administration back in January. ""We hear the cries of freedom coming from the island. The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" President Joe Biden said at the start of a White House meeting with Cuban Americans not long after Treasury announced the sanctions. The administration says it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. Biden added that more sanctions were in the offing. ADVERTISEMENT The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies.

The police were photographed confronting and arresting protesters in Havana, including members of the Movement of July 11 Mothers, a group founded to organize families of the imprisoned and disappeared, according to Treasury. In Camaguey, a Catholic priest was beaten and arrested by the PNR while he was defending young protesters, according to Treasury. PNR officers also beat a group of peaceful demonstrators, including several minors, and there have also been documented instances in which the PNR used clubs to break up peaceful protests across Cuba, Treasury said. ""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""Todays action serves to further hold accountable those responsible for suppressing the Cuban peoples calls for freedom and respect for human rights.""

The U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions, which appeared to be largely symbolic, were a reaction to ""actions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11.""

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""There will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate,"" Biden said during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders at the White House. His meeting came as the politically important community calls for more support for protests in Cuba that represent the biggest populist outpouring against the government on the Communist-run island in decades. ""The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,"" said Biden. Biden said he had asked the Treasury and State departments to report back in a month on how to allow remittance payments from Americans to Cubans without the Cuban government profiting. In addition, Biden has been working on a plan to try to provide wireless communications to Cubans and augment U.S. embassy staff in Cuba, a senior administration official said. The protests erupted this month amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of its old Soviet Union ally and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island.

""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regime's involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" wrote Andrea Gacki, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a statement announcing the sanctions.

""The Treasury Department will continue to designate and call out by name those who facilitate the Cuban regimes involvement in serious human rights abuse,"" said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Andrea M.

Ad The administration says it is considering a wide range of additional options in response to the protests, including providing internet access to Cubans, and has created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to ensure that more of the money that Cuban Americans send home makes it directly into the hands of their families without the government taking a cut. In the days before the recent protests, there were calls on social media for antigovernmental demonstrations. Cubas government said anti-Castro groups in the United States have used social media, particularly Twitter, to campaign against it and blamed Twitter for doing nothing to stop it. Internet service was cut off at one point during the July 11 protest, though Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. The White House meeting comes almost three weeks after unusual July 11 protests in which thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s. Ad Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the minister of the Cuban armed forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, and the Special Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior -- known as the ""boinas regras"" -- for having participated in the arrest of protesters. Several Cuban Americans were in attendance during Fridays meeting, including entertainers Emilio Estefan, Yotuel Romero and former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, now the Chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. Diaz applauded the sanctions. International organizations have harshly criticized the Cuban government, which has said that while people affected by the countrys crisis participated in the protests there were also ""criminals"" who took advantage of the situation to create disturbances. At times, the protests turned into vandalism with looting, robbery and confrontations with the police. Ad Government sympathizers also took to the streets to defend the authorities and the revolution. Human rights groups report more than 700 arrests and 500 people still in custody following the protests, although the judicial authorities have said there have been 19 trials involving 59 people.

Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who -- who have spoken out. Just disappearing. Ad Family members, Im told, are not able -- have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And -- in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people. The Cuban Americans are hurting. Theyre hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And its, quite frankly, intolerable. So, I want the Cuban Americans to know that we -- all around this table and myself included -- see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island. The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. Weve brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And were holding the regime accountable. Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban armed forces and the government -- a government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters. And, today, we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief -- the chief and deputy chief. And were going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out -- that carry out the regimes abuses. Ad At the same time, were increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide Internet access to help the Cuban bypass -- the Cuban people bypass the censorship thats being mandatorily imposed. You always know something is not going well when the -- a country will not allow -- will not allow their people to be engaged in -- be on the Internet and being able to make their case known around the world. And were expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents. And the direct State -- and Ive directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within one month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut. And were working to increase U.S. staffing at our embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel. So, weve got a lot to discuss with this group. So, we got -- and mostly, Im here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue. The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that -- you know, the American -- the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people. Ad And so, my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And were going to get down to business.

The Protests in Cuba from a Diplomatic Standpoint,https://havanatimes.org/features/the-protests-in-cuba-from-a-diplomatic-standpoint/,08/01/21,havanatimes.org,"Screenshot from a video taken in front of the Cuban Radio & Television Institute building on July 11, 2021. While many governments expressed concern over the violent Cuban government crackdown against peaceful protestors, they also oppose the US embargo on the island. By Laura Roque Valero (El Toque) HAVANA TIMES -The day after the demonstrations on Sunday, July 11, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, assured on national TV ""I can say that in general, the world has reacted with great respect and trust, which comes from knowing Cubas impeccable track record, always truthful and always transparent."" What has transpired the following days should oblige the foreign minister to qualify his discourse. The first declarations came from Cubas allies. On Monday July 12, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro expressed his support for Diaz Canels Government, while his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, forewarned threats of ""imperialist destabilization"" in the demonstrations in Cuba. Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at first avoided commenting in his customary Morning Meetings on Cubas internal matters and self-determination. At the same time, he offered to send vaccines and humanitarian aid. Days later he made known his proposal to consider Cuba the ""Patrimoney of Humanity"" seeing it as an ""example of resistance"" in relation to the US blockade. However, from the moment the demonstrations began, other dignitaries noted that the protesters complaints should be heard. At the core are the declarations from the United States, due to the historic conflict between the two countries, and because thats where the largest community of Cuban ex-patriots is located. Shortly after the protests, President Joe Biden joined the call for freedom in a press release from the White House: ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" On July 12th, Wendy Morton, the United Kingdoms Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for European Neighborhood and the Americas, called for calm and openness so that the Cubans can express their opinions. On July 21, the UKs ambassador in Havana, Antony Stokes, met with vice-minister Anayansi Rodriguez of Cubas Foreign Ministry (Minrex) to discuss a wide range of topics, among them ""the right to peaceful protests, acts of violence, detentions, internal and external blockades, attacks on social networks, internet shutdowns, fake news, freedom of the press,"" in addition to Cuban vaccines, cooperation in regards to the pandemic, travel restrictions, and other bilateral and multilateral matters. Less reserved, Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil, referred from the very beginning to a ""cruel dictatorship"" that ""massacres"" freedom and ""peddles to the world the fantasy of a socialist paradise."" On July 13, Lithuania, Peru, Spain and Sweden followed the development of events expressing concern about the deteriorating situation in Cuba and supporting the right to protest. Chiles Foreign Ministry stated in a press release that there was no justification for silencing Cuban citizens with repressive measures. The following day, Portugal, Germany, Colombia and Uruguay also came out against the violence, and troubled by the first officially recognized death resulting from the protests. The concern regarding respect for human rights and democracy were repeated in these messages. On July 15, the communiques focused on the court proceedings against the demonstrators and their irregularities. The Netherlands and Switzerland called for releasing those who participated peacefully in July 11 protests. Also on July 15, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned the repression and the use of force: ""The Commission maintains that official statements branding demonstrators as enemies are inadmissible and reckless. These statements stigmatize protest, foster an atmosphere that tolerates violence, may encourage clashes between citizens, and are incompatible with international standards to protect the right to protest,"" pointing out the duty of the Cuban State to guarantee this right, and its contemptable response of criminalizing it. Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed similar worries about the arrests and the use of excessive force against the demonstrators, and urged the Government to restore access to the Internet and social networks. Costa Rica, Ecuador, Canada, Poland and the Czech Republic also agreed about the lack of freedom and political rights of Cubans in relationship to their government. They petitioned for democracy, the end of repression, and for dialogue. Another point of agreement in several documents was to call for the end of the US embargo against the island. Poland, whose embassy in Havana has echoed the demand for the release of artist Hamlet Lavastida made by his 7-year-old son Leo, announced via its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting with the Cuban ambassador in Varsovia, Jose Marti Martinez, in which (in addition to acknowledge the increase in bilateral commerce) the Polish vice-minister Przydacz communicated his profound distress over the recent events in Cuba, demanding an end to the repression and the creation of a dialogue. In response to the international reaction, Cubas diplomacy focuses on the ones in their favor. FM Bruno Rodriguez, summing up a conversation with his Canadian counterpart, Marc Garneau, said that Cuba expressed its concern over human rights violations to native peoples in Canada. Communication from Canada, however, states that Garneau expressed ""profound preoccupation for the violent repression of the protests in Cuba, in particular the repressive measures against peaceful demonstrators, journalists and activists, and the arbitrary detentions."" In addition to these individual statements, on July 25 a joint statement was issued by the Governments of Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Greece, Honduras, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Korea, Ukraine, and the United States of America. ""On July 11, tens of thousands of Cuban citizens participated in peaceful demonstrations across the country to protest deteriorating living conditions and to demand change. They exercised universal freedoms of expression and assembly, rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the European Convention on Human Rights. ""We call on the Cuban government to respect the legally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the Cuban people without fear of arrest and detention. We urge the Cuban government to release those detained for exercising their rights to peaceful protest. We call for press freedom and for the full restoration of Internet access, which allows economies and societies to thrive. We urge the Cuban government to heed the voices and demands of the Cuban people. ""The international community will not waver in its support of the Cuban people and all those who stand up for the basic freedoms all people deserve."" This declaration is a word for word match to a message that the Cuban Foreign Minister leaked on his Twitter account a few days earlier. Rodriguez announced that the United States, with Bolsonaros support, was pressuring European and Latin American countries to sign on. The final number, 21 signatories, is not an earth-shattering number for an international community comprising 190 countries. Yet, it is noteworthy that countries such as Greece, Austria and Cyprus, which rarely comment on Cubas political system, signed along with countries that abstained (Colombia and Ukraine) in the recent vote against the US embargo, in the UN General Assembly. According to some analysts, most of the worlds governments that have come out against the repression of peaceful demonstrators in Cuba prefer not to combine it with rhetoric like ""failed State,"" which the Biden administration brandishes. This is because they are also critical of the embargo, so they prefer to speak solely about civil rights in Cuba. Obviously, they have not remained silent.

Cuba: Human Rights Activists Confirm 1000+ Arrests/Disappearances Since July 11,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/02/cuba-human-rights-activists-confirm-1000-arrests-disappearances-since-july-11/,08/02/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), a non-governmental organization that tracks detentions on the island, documented over 1,000 disappearances or arrests in Cuba between July 11, the day nationwide protests began on the island, and August 1. The July 11 protests triggered a global rallying cry for international action to end the 62-year-old Castro regime, which continues to maintain a stranglehold on the island despite attempts to portray President Miguel Diaz-Canel as a new leader distinct from the Castro family rulers embedded in the Communist Partys most powerful military positions. The protests themselves, occurring in as many as 40 different municipalities across the country, were the largest Cuba has experienced in years and followed extensive civil society organizing by various pro-democracy groups since at least the 2003 ""Black Spring"" crackdown. While the July 11 protests were, by all accounts, overwhelmingly peaceful, Cuban authorities responded by deploying state security and its repressive ""black beret"" special forces to conduct mass arrests, open fire on crowds of dissidents, and perform public beatings to scare anyone considering joining the movement. Diaz-Canel also appeared on television on the night of July 11 issuing an ""order of combat"" to civilians sympathetic with the regime, encouraging them to physically attack anyone they considered may support the protests. Dissidents on the island have described the nearly three weeks since the July 11 protests as intensely violent. The ""black beret"" forces have conducted door-to-door raids looking for suspected protesters in nearly every major city and shot protesters in their own homes. The legal system is so overwhelmed, according to the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders, that courts are processing and sentencing as many as 30 people at once with no regard for differences in their cases and, in many cases, not granting them access to an attorney. Initial reports from Cuban journalists working on the island suggested that police had detained as many as 5,000 people in the immediate aftermath of July 11. Activists still insist this week that the true toll of those missing and arresting remains incomplete as so many remote towns in the interior of the country engaged in protests and so many of those marching are not known active dissidents with networks outside of the country. As of Monday, however, the OCDH tally is the largest known confirmed number of people missing or in police custody since protests began. According to the NGO, 1,004 Cubans remain missing or arrested as of July 11, the vast majority of them (795) men. At least 21 of those arrested or disappeared are children, the group noted, describing the last few weeks in Cuba as ""20 days of savage repression."" 1004 detenciones/desapariciones en #Cuba desde #11J 20 dias de represion salvaje 795 hombres (16 de ellos menores de edad) 209 mujeres (5 de ellas menores de edad). pic.twitter.com/PBBPjGrU5q -- Observatorio Cubano de Derechos Humanos (@observacuba) August 1, 2021 Cuban police appeared to arrest some of the most internationally known political dissidents first as protests began. Still missing, with no proof of life, is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) Jose Daniel Ferrer. UNPACU is believed to be the largest pro-democracy group on the island, but no evidence suggests that Ferrer played any role in the protests. Ferrer is a veteran of the ""Black Spring"" arrests of 2003 and often faces arrest and disappearance, most recently disappeared in October 2019 and resurfacing 6 months later accusing the regime of torture and medical neglect in prison. The regime sentenced Ferrer to four years of house arrest in April 2020. Ferrer disappeared in far-east Santiago de Cuba. Also missing is the founder of the pro-democracy collective the San Isidro Movement, Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara. Oteros group was largely responsible for organizing large protests at the Ministry of Culture headquarters in Havana last year and suffers severe persecution, even though Otero himself has said that they ""do not want to topple the dictatorship."" Cuban police also appeared to disproportionately target religious leaders. The Cuban Communist Party is an atheist organization and has engaged in decades of intense persecution against Christians on the island. Groups like the santeria movement, who practice a syncretic religion largely based on Yoruba Nigerian paganism, have also endured persecution even among decades of rumors that Fidel Castro himself dabbled in santeria practices. In one particularly violent incident, Cuban authorities publicly beat a Catholic priest, Father Castor Jose Alvarez Devesa, and cracked his head before detaining him in his native Camaguey, which experienced some of the largest July 11 protests. Police released Alvarez only after receiving international condemnation and, in his message following his release, the clergyman clearly sported visible injuries to the head. Still missing are several members of the Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba, a santeria group that refuses to worship under the auspices of the atheist Communist Party. According to the Global Liberty Alliance, a human rights advocacy group, at least six members were arrested for participating in protests. The OCDH estimated in a report published in July that Cuban repressive forces have performed over 30,000 politically motivated arrests in the last five years, many repeat incidents against the islands most vocal dissidents.

Cuba Threatens to Attack America: 'We Are Armed',https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/03/cuba-threatens-attack-america-we-are-armed/,08/03/21,www.breitbart.com,"The official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, Granma, published a commentary on Tuesday warning President Joe Biden that the regime ""has the weapons ... to repel any aggression"" and is willing to engage in a conflict with America. Biden has not adopted a coherent policy towards Cuba, which for the past 62 years has endured the repression of a violent, anti-American communist regime. Following nationwide protests calling for the end of communism on July 11, which some estimates suggest attracted nearly 200,000 participants nationwide, Cuban-Americans on the mainland have encouraged Biden to consider various avenues of humanitarian and military aid for the protesters. Those asking Biden to implement a Cuba policy were in part reacting to the Castro regimes response to the protests, largely defined by police brutality including violent door-to-door raids, torture and sexual abuse of prisoners, public beatings, and opening fire on peaceful crowds. Castro regime figurehead Miguel Diaz-Canel issued a call on national television on the evening of July 11 for civilians to violently assault anyone considered a ""counterrevolutionary,"" labeling it an ""order of combat"" in defense of the ""revolution."" Biden has so far responded to the ongoing protests in Cuba by holding a meeting with Cuban-American celebrities and sanctioning three individuals already under sanctions set in place by former President Donald Trump. The column in Granma on Tuesday accused Biden, despite his lack of decisive action towards the regime, of being ""poorly advised, erratic, irresolute,"" and ""an ally of the Republican right and Trumpism."" ""Anti-Cuban lawmakers ... Miami haters, supported by representatives of the Trumpist far-right of the United States, fueled by the resentment that defines them, continue to demand that the government of Joe Biden intervene militarily in Cuba,"" the article read. ""A wave of bellicose hysteria sweeps the media and, above all, social media. We have seen the very images of Dantes circles of Hell, where some of the enthusiasts promoting death will end up going."" The Cuban Communist Party is officially an atheist entity and does not recognize the existence of Hell. The column concluded warning Biden that the Castro regime would embrace a war with the United States. ""We are lovers of peace, we want to build a prosperous future for our children and grandchildren, we want fair relations, based on principles, with your country,"" the column said, addressing Biden. ""But we are not an unarmed people, Mr. Biden, we have weapons and, more importantly, the souls ready to repel any aggression. Do not be fooled: the adventure would be unpayable for you."" The official position of the Cuban Communist Party is that the protests of July 11, which swept dozens of cities nationwide, were a U.S. intelligence operation organized by Cuban-American terrorists, not a legitimate manifestation of the Cuban people. Juventud Rebelde, another state propaganda outlet, described the protests as ""actions against the Cuban Revolution ... oriented from the United States by elements of the Cuban-American right to try to destabilize the country."" Another propaganda outlet, the Havana Tribune, referred to the overwhelmingly peaceful protests as an act of foreign ""terrorism."" Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez has both accused American agents of instigating the protests and denied any violence against protesters, complaining that he has seen ""worse [repression] in Europe,"" without offering any examples. The U.S. State Department formally recognizes the Castro regime as a state sponsor of terrorism alongside Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Cubas most well-documented terrorist tie is with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a narco-terrorist organization whose leaders lived in Havana for years following a joint U.S. campaign with the administration of former President Alvaro Uribe that largely disabled the group in the 2000s. With Raul Castros intervention, another Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, offered the FARC a ""peace deal"" that allowed the leaders to return home as senators, fueling a drug and violence boom in the country ongoing today. The Cuban Communist Party is also a close ally of Irans and is known to have ties to the jihadist organization Hezbollah. A leaked Obama-era intelligence report from 2016 warned that Hezbollah could launch attacks against America from Cuba. That same year, a leak from the now-defunct law firm Mossack Fonseca known as the Panama papers revealed that Cuba had bankrolled an operation to grant Hezbollah members legitimate Venezuelan passports, despite them being citizens of Mideast states with no ties to Venezuela, allowing them to move more freely in the Western Hemisphere. Cuba is also formally an ally of several enemies of the United States, most prominently Russia and China. A report published last week by the independent outlet ADN Cuba revealed that Chinas Peoples Armed Police (PAP) had aided Cuba by training its ""black berets,"" a repressive police force used to disappear political dissidents. Chinese state media had openly admitted to using the PAP for law enforcement outreach in Cuba over a decade ago. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
Cuba Continues Home Invasions Against Protesters,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/04/cuba-continues-home-invasions-against-protesters-three-weeks-after-national-marches/,08/04/21,www.breitbart.com,"Communist state security forces in Cuba have not ceased raiding the homes of and arresting individuals believed to have participated in the July 11 nationwide protests, most recently disappearing dissident Sadiel Gonzalez from his home on Monday night. Gonzalezs family told the independent Cuban outlet 14 y Medio that Gonzalez remains missing as of Tuesday following police entering his Havana home on Monday night and requesting an ""interview"" at the police station. Gonzalez had broadcast a live stream on Facebook of the protests on July 11 and participated in them. Unlike many who have been arrested or otherwise disappeared into the Communist Party criminal system, Gonzalez has a track record of dissident activity and had most recently participated in a protest in April prior to July 11. Gonzalezs arrest became publicly known because he filmed the visit by police on Monday -- which reportedly occurred after 9 p.m. local time, past the curfew imposed to prevent the spread of Chinese coronavirus in the capital city. Police did not present a warrant for his arrest or state that he would face any charges, leaving unclear why they came to his home. Video Gonzalez posted on Facebook showed an officer asking Gonzalez to accompany the police to ""have a conversation at the police station"" but authorities ultimately place him in handcuffs and take him away. Responding to outraged demands for an explanation from his mother, one officer reportedly says, ""its for an interview, mom, dont worry about it."" Another officer, following Gonzalezs departure in a police car, told his mother that the man was ""involved in counterrevolutionary acts"" and explained that he had livestreamed video of himself on Monday promoting more protests against the Castro regime. The arrest on Monday offers proof that persecutions related to the July 11 protests continue three weeks later, even as calls for international aid to the protesters, particularly in the United States, have largely fallen on deaf ears. The administration of President Joe Biden implemented redundant sanctions on two individuals in response to the violent crackdowns following July 11, but has not taken any more significant measures and, following a meeting last week with Cuban celebrities, has not indicated he has plans for more action in the future. The July 11 protests were a spontaneous eruption of discontent against the communist regime, in power for 62 years, that occurred in nearly every city in the country. Some estimates suggest as many as 200,000 Cubans participated in the protests, which mostly consisted of peaceful marches and assemblies in public squares. The Castro regime responded to the protests by immediately demanding that pro-revolutionary civilians physically assault dissidents in public and executing door-to-door raids to arrest suspected protesters. Some police officers used live ammunition to fire into peaceful crowds; many arrested individuals near protests for whom there was no evidence of participation, including children. According to the human rights group Cuban Prisoners Defenders in a report published this week, ""an impossible-to-determine number between 2,000 and 8,000 people"" were detained and remain in police custody as a result of police activity last month, the vast majority of it on July 11 or in the days following. The organization noted that, in the vast majority of these cases, the individuals imprisoned do not receive due process, meaning many have not even been charged with a crime while remaining under police custody. Underlining this lack of respect for legal rights, Prisoners Defenders could only confirm the existence of 272 political prisoners on the island as of June, defined as individuals tried and convicted of crimes consisting of disagreements with the government. The rest are merely in police custody without being convicted -- or in many cases indicted -- of a crime. Yet another alarming category of prisoner are dissidents serving time for ""pre-criminal"" behavior. According to Cuban Prisoners Defenders, 11,000 Cubans fit this category. These are individuals the regime considers a threat but for whom no evidence of any act that can be interpreted in any way as a crime exists. Another significant group of people the Communist Party deems enemies of the state are consistently beholden to informal house arrest arrangements. This method is especially used in the cases of journalists. Luz Escobar, the 14 y Medio reporter who wrote the story on Gonzalezs arrest, regularly reports being unable to leave her home for unclear reasons. On Wednesday, Escobar filmed a suspected state security agent -- ""he refused to identify himself"" -- at her front door preventing her from leave her home. ""Theres a lot of COVID out there, its better if you stay home,"" the unidentified man says in the video, adding a request to go upstairs to her apartment that Escobar rejects, citing a lack of warrant, legal identification, or any explanation for who this man is or why he is preventing her from leaving her home. #4deAgosto si! De nuevo han llegado a los bajos de mi edificio los enviados de la Seguridad del Estado para impedirme salir. Aqui pueden escuchar como se niega a identificarse y su expresion de ""afuera hay covid"". De nuevo todo ilegal y arbitrario. #SosCuba #InformarNoEsDelito pic.twitter.com/pNMbJUVqHS -- Luz Escobar #SOScuba (@Luz_Cuba) August 4, 2021 The status of many others remains unknown since July 11, as the government effectively disappeared them without explanation. The most prominent of these cases is that of Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), believed to be the largest dissident group on the island. No evidence suggests that Ferrer participated in the protests on July 11 or that UNPACU helped organize them, but authorities took him out of his Santiago de Cuba home that day and his family have not received any explanation or updates on his whereabouts since.

"DeSantis, House GOP Leader McCarthy pressure Biden to do more for Cuba",https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2021/08/05/watch-live-desantis-house-gop-leader-mccarthy-speak-in-south-florida/,08/05/21,www.local10.com,"A visit to South Florida was aimed at pressuring the Biden administration into stronger action against the Cuban government. There were also clear political reasons for the show of force in Hialeah Gardens on Thursday. HIALEAH GARDENS, Fla. - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday that they ""will not back down"" as they push for democracy and freedom in Cuba and throughout Latin America. They spoke at a news conference in Hialeah Gardens after meeting with South Floridians from several Latin American countries earlier Thursday morning. Their message was aimed at ratcheting up pressure on President Joe Biden to proactively help the Cuban people. ""Mr. President, weve requested a meeting. Why? Because if you cant come up with ideas, we have them,"" Rep. McCarthy said. ""We can tell you the solutions. We will stand with you if you will act."" WATCH A REPLAY BELOW: Others who spoke at the news conference included Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and U.S. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Salazar of South Florida. House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Mike McCaul (Texas) and fellow U.S. Reps. Mark Green (Tennessee) and Victoria Spartz (Indiana) also participated. Ad Earlier Thursday, the group met with members of the Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan and Peruvian communities in South Florida to voice support for democracy in Latin America. ""DeSantis said what he has always said. Hes with the side of the Cuban people,"" said Ninoska Perez, who attended the roundtable discussion at Las Vegas Cuban Cuisine in Doral. ""He supports the Cuban-American community, and were really happy that hes the governor of Florida."" Perez was also impressed with McCarthys visit, saying: ""Its extraordinary that the leader of the Republican majority would come to Miami and see for himself what this community is all about."" It comes in the wake of widespread protests in Cuba last month that also sparked demonstrations here in South Florida. Thousands took to the streets of Cuba to protest shortages of food and medicine, restrictions on civil liberty, and the communist-run governments handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ad Gimenez, the former Miami-Dade County mayor, said he wants President Joe Biden to declare the Cuban government illegitimate because of its actions to punish protesters. Republican members of Congress are also pushing for the Biden administration to deliver internet to the island. ""If theres one message that were waiting for the Biden administration to do something about it, I have said it many times, we need two things: leadership and connectivity. Im talking about internet,"" Salazar said in an interview between the roundtable and the news conference. Asked how specifically the Biden administration help restore internet in Cuba, Salazar said: ""Well, the Biden administration can give the green light to those companies who have the technology to put up the balloons or whatever it is, satellite. Were not talking -- Im not talking about technology. Im talking about political willingness."" Ad Salazar later said that the news conference that ""patience is running out"" for what they see as Bidens half-hearted efforts to support Cuban dissidents. Biden has called Cuba a ""failed state."" He drummed up support from 20 nations for dissidents, set up a commission to study remittances, and has promised to look into restoring Cubans internet access. While the show of force by Republicans is part of an ongoing campaign to put pressure on the Biden administration, the Democrats are in fact also taking a hard line against the Cuban government. But the GOP has had a louder voice -- and more passion. ""Let the world see what is going on,"" McCarthy said. Theres also a purely political angle to this call for action in Cuba. The three Cuban-American members of Congress from South Florida are all up for re-election next year.",
Reports: Cuba's Internet Shutdown Fueled by Chinese Big Tech,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/05/reports-cubas-internet-shutdown-fueled-by-chinese-big-tech/,08/05/21,www.breitbart.com,"The Communist Partys State Telecommunications Company of Cuba (ETECSA) relied on technology from Chinese mega-firms such as Huawei and ZTE to shut down nationwide access to the internet following protests on July 11, multiple reports concluded this week. The Spanish outlet Diario de Cuba noted, heavily citing an investigation published this week by the Asian affairs site The Diplomat, that Huawei has been operating in the communist country since at least 2000, when it agreed to a contract to build a fiber optic network on the island. Huawei has increasingly expanded its footprint in Cuba, with the Communist Partys blessing, in the mobile phone industry, while other Chinese firms with close ties to the regime there like ZTE and TP-Link have also established a growing role in granting Cuban citizens access to the internet. The internet played a pivotal role in the July 11 protests, believed to be the largest on the island since the ""Black Spring"" crackdown against pro-democracy dissidents in 2003. According to the Cuban Conflict Observatory (OCC), an NGO that tracks the scope and intensity of political opposition on the island, 187,000 people participated in protests in Cuba throughout July, the vast majority stepping out to join marches and rallies calling for the end of the communist regime on July 11. The protests were overwhelmingly peaceful despite their size and presence in, according to some estimates, as many as 40 people on the island. Participants used the internet - particularly access to social media - to encourage others to take the streets and inform each other about protest meeting points. Protesters also relied on social media to spread videos and images of the disproportionate use of violence on behalf of Cuban police and other state security forces against unarmed and peaceful dissidents. In the immediate aftermath of the beginning of the protests, the videos showed both the sheer number of people on the street and outrageous uses of police force - such as opening fire on crowds of unarmed protesters and shooting suspected protesters in their homes in front of their children. Shortly after Castro figurehead Miguel Diaz-Canel issued an ""order of combat"" demanding civilians engage in violence against the protesters, ETECSA abruptly cut internet access on nearly the entirety of the island. Cubans have since been subsisting using VPNs and intermittent ETECSA access that has returned only in the past week. Without Chinese technology, The Diplomat report contended, such a pervasive internet blackout would not be possible. ""Chinese companies have played a key part in building Cubas telecommunications infrastructure, a system the regime uses to control its people, just as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) does within its own borders,"" the outlet observed. ""The primary technology providers for Etecsa, Cubas sole internet access company, are all Chinese: Huawei, TP-Link, and ZTE."" Huawei, in particular, helps Cuba control what websites Cubans on the island can access. As, according to a U.S. State Department report from 2019, Huawei also controls much of the islands Wi-Fi access - which many Cubans use through their Huawei mobile phones - it is among the top culprits for aiding Cuba in silencing its people online. ""China dominates Cubas telecommunication sector and provides a challenge to U.S. firms looking to enter the sector,"" the State Department noted at the time. ""China played a major role in financing and constructing Cubas ALBA-1 undersea cable and Huawei Technologies, a Chinese telecommunications company, was involved in developing Cubas backbone network as well as installing Wi-Fi hotspots across the island."" China largely controls the Cuban telecommunications market without competition, in part because limits on American companies exist in doing business with the repressive communist regime in Cuba (similar restrictions do not exist regarding China, despite both nations running on the same political system). The Chinese Communist Party publicly complains about these restrictions regularly, using state media to claim that the ""embargo"" significantly damages the Cuban economy. Evidence suggests, however, that even without an ""embargo"" the Castro regime would not allow American companies to compete fairly. In 2015, at the height of President Barack Obamas ""thaw"" policy granting economic and political concessions to the Castro regime, Google reportedly attempted to enter negotiations to build telecommunications infrastructure in Cuba. Google spent years attempting to convince both sides of the Straits of Florida to allow it to work in Cuba; on one occasion, CEO Eric Schmidt visited Cuba alongside former Republican senator Jeff Flake seeking to cut a deal with Diaz-Canel. Even during the Obama, era, however, experts considered such a deal unlikely because of the overwhelming presence of Chinese companies there in the field already. ""I dont see them using Google if they have a Chinese option,"" Baruch College professor Ted Henken told CNBC in 2015. Internet access at the time in Cuba was far more limited, typically reserved for the Castroite elite, than it was immediately before the July 11 blackout. China issued effusive statements of support for the Castro regime in the aftermath of last months demonstrations. ""China firmly opposes foreign interference in Cubas internal affairs, firmly supports what Cuba has done in fighting COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], improving peoples livelihood and upholding social stability,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the week after, ""and firmly supports Cuba in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions."" Zhao appeared to be referencing false leftist claims that the protests were a reaction to Cubas extremely poor handling of the pandemic and not a call for regime change. ""Id like to stress that China stands ready to work with Cuba to implement the important consensus of the two heads of state and is firmly committed to deepening friendly relations between the two countries,"" Zhao added, without elaborating. China has been Cubas largest trade partner since at least 2017. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
GOP: Biden not doing enough to help Cubans access internet,https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-cuba-143c4e13cf7a840c480c860682272757,08/05/21,apnews.com,"MIAMI (AP) -- House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and fellow GOP politicians accused President Joe Biden on Thursday of not doing more to help Cubans on the island get access to the internet. Internet service was cut off at one point during a July 11 protest against the communist government, but Cuban authorities have not explicitly acknowledged that they did it. Service is still spotty across the island more than three weeks later. McCarthy met in Miami on Thursday with members of the states Cuban-American congressional delegation, Republican Gov. and aspiring presidential candidate Ron DeSantis and Republican Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez. At a news conference afterward, Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said that while specific companies had expressed a willingness to step in and help, the White House has ignored the Cuban-American delegation. Salazar said ""patience is running out."" ADVERTISEMENT Biden has said the administration is working to identify options to make the internet more accessible on the island. Internet in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. The Cuban government restricts independent news media and censors whats available online. It also disrupts internet access. Last Friday, Biden announced new sanctions against Cubas national revolutionary police and its top two officials. The president also created a working group to review U.S. remittance policy to make sure the communist government is not taking a cut of the money Cubans send from the U.S. to the island. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said last month that the government was not taking any of the money. Former President Donald Trumps administration took more than 200 actions against Cuba, including limiting individual trips to the island from the U.S., barring cruise ship visits and capping remittances. The Republicans gathered in Miami said Thursday that they were against lifting the caps. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said increasing remittances is ""something the regime has been asking for."" Diaz-Balart added that he had participated in previous classified briefings during which several options to improve access to the internet had been presented. He said he could not release any details, but that such measures had been used in other countries. Cubans used the internet to spread word on social media about last months anti-government demonstrations. Thousands showed up in Havana and other cities to object to government policies in large protests, the likes of which had not been seen in decades. ""Remember why you want to do this,"" McCarthy said of improving and maintaining internet access for Cuban residents. ""You want individuals, those in Cuba craving freedom, to understand we are with them.""",

Wasserman Schultz said, ""Well, first of all, the July 11 historic protests across most major cities in Cuba were so incredibly important. And you know, the fact that the regime and other Cuba supporters were downplaying them as being related to COVID or to economic pressure rather than the burning desire of the Cuban people to be free and to be able to elect their own leaders and to be able to make their own decisions in their own right without fear of repression was very clear.""

Cuba is seeing a surge in unauthorized migration to the United States, fueled by an economic crisis. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) Zuleydis ""Zuly"" Elledias, left, shows a cellphone photo of her missing husband to a child while her neighbors pose for a group picture holding up cellphone photos of their missing relatives who ventured out in homemade boats in an attempt to reach Florida, in Orlando Nodarse, about 60 kilometers west of Havana, Cuba, Wednesday, June 30, 2021. Cuba is seeing a surge in unauthorized migration to the United States, fueled by an economic crisis. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) ORLANDO NODARSE, Cuba (AP) -- Zuleydis Elledias has gotten up each morning for the past two months hoping for a phone call, a message -- any news on the fate of her husband and nephew, who disappeared at sea after the boat they were in capsized as they tried to reach Florida. Another half dozen families in the small town of Orlando Nodarse, 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of Havana and near the port of Mariel, are living with the same uncertainty. ""Due to the pandemic my husband lost his job. Many places closed and he had been home for more than a year. Every time he went to his workplace, they told him to wait. And that made him desperate because we have a 2-year-old son,"" Elledias, a 38-year-old homemaker, told The Associated Press through tears. Cuba is seeing a surge in unauthorized migration to the United States, fueled by an economic crisis exacerbated by the pandemic, increased U.S. sanctions and cutbacks in aid from its also-crisis-wracked Venezuelan ally. That has led to shortages in many goods and a series of protests that shook the island on July 11. ADVERTISEMENT And legal ways to leave have been strained by the Trump administrations near-closure of the U.S. Consulate in 2017 following a series of mysterious illnesses among diplomatic personnel that some claimed could result from an attack -- allegations Cuba bitterly denies. Most Cubans who want to try for a U.S. visa now have to go to embassies in other countries -- and getting there is almost impossible due to sharp cuts in air traffic during the pandemic. Most cant afford tickets anyway unless relatives abroad can front them the money. That has pushed many Cubans to launch themselves into the sea on small boats or rafts to attempt the dangerous crossing of the Florida Straits to the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard said recently it has intercepted 595 Cubans at sea since the current fiscal year started on Oct. 1. Thats larger than any any full fiscal year since 2017 -- during which the U.S. announced that even Cubans reaching U.S. shores were likely to be expelled, ending a longstanding policy of granting asylum to those who reached dry land. Its still small in comparison with the nearly 5,400 halted at sea in 2016 or the dramatic crises of 1994-1995 and 1980, when Cubas government temporarily stopped trying to block departures and tens of thousands set out en masse. Thousands died in the ocean. Its also still far smaller than the current flow of those who have somehow made their way to the continent and worked their way north. The U.S. Border Patrol had recorded 26,196 Cubans trying to enter the U.S. without documents between Oct. 1 and June 30, most by land. As well as her husband -- 45-year-old driver Fernando Quinones -- Elledias is also awaiting word on her nephew, Ismel Reyes, 22, who worked on a farm. ADVERTISEMENT They were among a group of 18 men and two women who left Cuba for Florida on May 25. The boat sank the following night and survivors were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard about 18 miles (29 kilometers) southwest of Key West. The search by sea, land and air lasted for days. ""Something happened, I dont know, the currents, the boat flipped. The United States Coast Guard rescued eight people alive, found two bodies and there are 10 people missing,"" Elledias said. Among the survivors were four cousins of Elledias, some of whom have already been repatriated to Cuba. Elledias, her sister Sudenis -- Reyes mother -- and other Orlando Nodarse residents who spoke with the AP all agreed that the risky decision to head for the United States was triggered by the economic crisis and the difficulties in obtaining a visa. Cuban historian Alina Barbara Lopez noted that two earlier mass exoduses by sea were spawned by crises and Cuban authorities opened the borders as a kind of release valve in the face of social pressure. In 1980, with unhappy Cubans pouring into foreign embassy compounds seeking visas, Fidel Castro opened the port at Mariel for people who wanted to leave and 125,000 Cubans rushed north, setting off a political crisis for the government of U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The dire economic tailspin of the early 1990s following the collapse of Cubas aid from the Soviet Union led tens of thousands to put to sea in innertubes, makeshift rafts and highjacked boats. Then too, many died. But now Havana is ""trapped"" because it cannot open its borders due to migration agreements signed with the Washington in that wake of that crisis, she said. Meanwhile, Cubas economic reforms have only been superficial, Lopez said. The economy remains stagnant. ""All this makes the underlying political foundation of this crisis much stronger than in the previous"" crises, she said. Cuban authorities acknowledge there are ""symptoms"" of a possible migratory crisis but say it could be deactivated if President Joe Biden fulfills a campaign promise to jettison Trumps tighter sanctions, which were aimed at trying to drive the Communist Party from power, and resumes the dialogue launched by former U.S. President Barack Obama. ""The situation we have now is the result of a number of negative factors,"" said Jesus Perz Calderon of the United States department at Cubas Foreign Ministry. ""In the first place, the deterioration of the economy as a result of COVID-19 ... but at the same time the resurgence of an economic war of blockade against Cuba by the United States."" Jose Ramon Cabanas, a former Cuban ambassador to the U.S. and current director of the Center for International Policy Research, said both nations have instruments in place to prevent an exodus to Florida, ""There are agreements in force but they are not being fully applied,"" Cabanas said. The United States had been providing 22,000 visas a year to Cuba for two decades until 2017, when Trump froze relations. The consulate shutdown made applying for a visa almost moot for most Cubans. In addition, at the beginning of 2017, Obama eliminated the policy known as ""wet foot-dry foot"" that let Cubans who reached U.S. shores remain, usually as refugees, while those caught at sea were sent back. Back in Orlando Nodarse, Elledias hopes a miracle will bring home her loved ones. ""I would tell people who are thinking about this option (of crossing the Florida Straits) not to do it, that it is not a safe route. There is no money in the world that can pay for this suffering we are going through,"" she said.",
"Cuba Funeral Crisis: Coffins Falling Apart, Families Digging Up Relatives to Bury More",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/09/cuba-funeral-crisis-coffins-falling-apart-families-digging-up-relatives-to-bury-more/,08/09/21,www.breitbart.com,"Morgues, funeral homes, and cemeteries in Cuba are failing in almost every respect to provide adequate service to families - from coffin shortages to lack of refrigeration for bodies - the Cuban independent outlet 14 y Medio reported on Sunday, due to skyrocketing numbers of deaths on the island. The Chinese coronavirus crisis has significantly worsened on the island this summer as a result of extreme government mismanagement. The Communist Party has actively promoted foreign tourism from some of nations most affected by the pandemic, including virus origin nation China and 2020 hotbed Italy, and forced citizens to spend hours on long, crowded ration lines to attain basic food goods and other home necessities. Following the July 11 national protests, the Party has also forced citizens to participate in crowded ""acts of revolutionary affirmation"" to give the world the false impression that the communist system retains popular support. Cuba has also rejected offers from the international community - including from America - to send doses of some of the worlds most effective coronavirus vaccines, opting instead for several homemade, unproven vaccine candidates. As of Friday, Havanas Public Health Ministry reported that 72 percent of recently detected cases in the city occurred in people who had received three doses of ""Abdala,"" believed to be the most advanced Cuban coronavirus vaccine candidate. The spike in coronavirus cases has sent the collapsed socialist healthcare system into a frenzy that has significantly impacted other patients, raising the death rate now that individuals with treatable conditions are not receiving the medical care they need. In Havana, central Ciego de Avila, and eastern Santiago de Cuba in particular, the situation has resulted in an overwhelming number of bodies for the government to handle. Family members report that funeral homes and cemeteries in many parts of Cuba have run out of lumber for coffins and any fabric to drape the coffins in. Typically, those building coffins in Cuba use black fabric to hide the raw wooden color, but many report running out of black-colored cloth and simply using white, a jarring contrast to tradition. Some reports in Havana indicate that all colors are running now, leaving builders to sloppily decorate coffins in multiple colors. The material used to build the coffins has also devastated family members. The outlet 14 y Medio spoke to several people who had recently lost loved ones who said the wood used for coffins was of such low quality, it appeared to be closer to cardboard and was constantly on the verge of breaking, letting the body inside fall out. ""My brother got a white coffin, something that jarred us because it was not the most common, but they told us that that was the fabric available,"" Margarita Luaces, whose brother the government listed as a Chinese coronavirus death in Ciego de Avila, told 14 y Medio. ""It also did not have any of the metal ornaments that they used to put on them [the coffins] before and when they lowered it into the grave, one of the corners opened up, it was a horrible sight."" Luaces said the coffin ""was barely carryable because it seemed like it was going to fall apart ... we were afraid the body would fall out."" Monica Estrada, who lost a sister to non-coronavirus-related disease, told the outlet that finding a coffin was only the start of problems for families of the dead. ""When you get to the cemetery its a whole other problem,"" she lamented, ""there are families ... going into family mausoleums to take out the remains of some relative who died a long time ago to make room for someone who recently died."" ""You have to take a dead person out to put another one in because theres no space,"" she added. Ciego de Avila is experiencing one of the worst shortages of burial space in the country. Reports from the area last week indicated that the government had begun to ""expand"" one of the largest local cemeteries into residents backyards without asking, resulting in piles of bodies in peoples homes flooding them with the scent of decaying remains. The government ""flooded us with bodies everywhere,"" Moraima Lugo, a local resident, told 14 y Medio. The surplus of human remains does not stop at cemeteries. Another independent outlet, Cubanet, reported on Sunday that hospitals and morgues are struggling to move bodies out to make room for more patients and keep medical areas sanitized. Cubanet published a video, reportedly taken at a hospital morgue in Manzanillo, Eastern Cuba. The video shows bodies on cots lined up in the hospitals hallways, clearly unrefrigerated and apparently unlabeled. Warning - Graphic: In Santiago de Cuba, the largest city in the east of the country, some hospitals and funeral homes report failing to efficiently dispose of the bodies because the citys hearses have broken down. Spains Diario de Cuba reported on Friday that only four of the 20 hearses the government keeps in Santiago are functioning. Some have broken-down lights, lack windshield wipers, or have had their windows broken and repaired with sheets of nylon and thus unsafe for transporting bodies. Diario de Cuba also identified another hospital, this time in Santiago, that did not have refrigeration available for bodies of the diseased. The bodies ""were piled up on cots or on the floor,"" according to a nurse who relayed the information to the outlet anonymously. The Juan Gonzalez Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba is currently filling three mass graves, one for coronavirus patients and two others for general use, according to Diario de Cuba. Videos circulating of the mass graves on social media last week, and of relatives claiming the government lost the bodies of their loved ones in the desperate attempt to bury as many people as possible, prompted accusations of ""fake news"" on the part of Cuban government propaganda outlets. The denials came with the admission, however, that the government appeared not to know where to put so many bodies. Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, admitted on Friday that the regime had taken ""organizational measures"" to transport a significant number of bodies to Juan Gonzalez Cemetery because the neighboring Santa Ifigenia Cemetery was overcrowded. ""Due to these conditions, it was decided to inter those dead of any cause (not just COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus]) in Juan Gonzalez Cemetery whose families did not have a private mausoleum or who were not cremated,"" Granma alleged, leaving open the question of exactly how the government is burying those bodies.

The Facebook group that staged first in Cuba's wave of protests,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/facebook-group-that-staged-first-cubas-wave-protests-2021-08-09/,08/09/21,www.reuters.com,"People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - ""Tired of having no electricity?"" read a post in a Facebook group for residents of the small Cuban town of San Antonio de los Banos on July 10. ""Fed up of having to listen to the impudence of a government that doesn't care about you?"" ""It's time to go out and to make demands. Don't criticize at home: let's make them listen to us"". The next day, thousands took to the street in San Antonio, a town of some 50,000 people, 30 km (20 miles) southwest of Havana, kicking off a rare wave of protests throughout the Communist-run country. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Unrest has been growing across Latin America and the Caribbean as unease spreads over COVID-19 lockdowns and rising poverty. But in Cuba authorities have traditionally tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by old Cold War foe the United States. The protests, Cuba's most widespread since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, appeared largely spontaneous as Cubans vented frustrations over long lines for food, power outages, medicine shortages as well as curbs on civil freedoms. Yet an investigation by non-state Cuban outlet El Estornudo - cited by state television and confirmed by Reuters - recently showed that the first protest was convened online by a San Antonio community forum for local people and those who had emigrated. The Facebook group ""City of Humor"" - the nickname for San Antonio which hosts a biannual humor festival - was first created in 2017 as a social space, according to one of its three administrators, Miami-based Alexander Perez. Over time, people also started expressing their gripes, said Perez, 44, a pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. That prompted him and the other administrators Danilo Roque and Lazaro Gonzalez to try to ""educate them"" about their civil rights and claiming them through peaceful protest. Neither Roque nor Gonzalez, whom Perez described as two younger men who lived in San Antonio operating under the pseudonyms to avoid reprisals, responded to request for comment. The backstory shows how the recent expansion of web access in Cuba has been a gamechanger in fostering forums on social media to share criticism and to mobilize. It also shows how strengthening relations with the Cuban diaspora - thanks to the internet and greater freedom of movement - is influencing politics on the island at a grassroots level. Virtual communities like ""The City of Humor"" exist nationwide and emigres are exhorting local people on them to keep on protesting and expressing solidarity, with some even urging violence. All this poses a challenge to the government which has allowed relatively unfettered access to the internet, unlike China, which blocks many Western social media apps. Cuba has blamed the protests on online meddling by counter-revolutionaries backed by the United States, which has for decades openly sought to force reform on it through sanctions and financing for democracy programs. The administrators of the ""City of Humor"" did not receive any U.S. funding nor had they coordinated protests with other towns, Perez said. Cuba, where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications, has suffered intermittent disruptions in access to internet and social media since July 11, in an apparent bid to prevent further unrest. Protests petered out within a couple of days amid those outages, a large deployment of security forces and a wave of detentions. TEACHING CIVIL RIGHTS Posts in ""The City of Humor"" - which jumped from around 4,000 to nearly 10,000 members after the July 11 protest - show users reminiscing, selling items, promoting businesses and complaining about local issues like water supply. Perez said the administrators decided three years ago to also attempt to rally the community to demonstrate over shared gripes, with little success. Last month they felt the time was ripe to try again. The pandemic and tighter U.S. sanctions had exacerbated Cuba's economic woes, plunging it into its deepest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union. And the COVID-19 surge was pushing its already creaking healthcare infrastructure to the brink. ""We decided this was the moment,"" said Perez. The announcement of the protest at the church park at 11 a.m. spread by word-of-mouth and messenging applications, according to three San Antonio residents who requested anonymity. But Perez said he had such low expectations that anyone would show up that he went to the beach that day. So he was stunned to get a call to say the small early turnout had snowballed. ""We certainly never imagined that San Antonio would be the spark that lit the flame causing Cuba to take to the streets three hours later,"" he said. Videos on social media showed San Antonio protesters shouting anti-government slogans like ""freedom"" and ""we are not afraid"". ""My town came out in force because it just can't take any more,"" said one resident, requesting anonymity. Within hours, President Miguel Diaz-Canel himself showed up, in a bid - he said later in a televised address to the nation - to show ""the streets belong to revolutionaries"". Some videos on social media showed him being heckled but the unrest there and elsewhere soon dwindled amid a crackdown. Perez said a heavy security presence in San Antonio meant Cubans would have to bide their time until another protest. But it was noteworthy, he said, that the government already enacted reforms like lifting customs restrictions for travelers bringing in medicine and food in response to the protests. ""If we manage to achieve this in a few hours of protest"" he wondered, ""what happens if we spend three days in the streets?""

Instead, Mr. Biden is taking an even harder line on Cuba than his predecessor, President Donald J. Trump, who tightened restrictions on travel and financial transactions. The island became an early foreign policy crisis for the Biden administration after Cubans poured into the streets to denounce their authoritarian government and the food and medicine shortages exacerbated by the pandemic. The rare act of rebellion was quashed with the biggest crackdown on dissent in a generation. The White House imposed new sanctions against Cuban officials in the past few weeks in response to the arrest of hundreds of protesters who took to the streets in cities across the island nation on July 11. Mr. Biden also asked government experts to draw up plans for the United States to unilaterally expand internet access on the island and has pledged to increase support for Cuban dissidents.",
Coast Guard returns 29 migrants to Cuba after intercepting 4 vessels,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/08/10/coast-guard-returns-29-migrants-to-cuba-after-intercepting-4-vessels/,08/10/21,www.local10.com,"Two Cubans in a 10-foot styrofoam hull rustic vessel are intercepted near Key West, Aug. 3, 2021.

They were among the 29 Cubans the U.S. Coast Guard returned to the Communist-run island after failed attempts to get away from economic ruin during the coronavirus pandemic. Last year alone, the Coast Guard reported intercepting 49 Cuban migrants at sea. Last week, the Coast Guard intercepted 32 people in four vessels coming from Cuba off the Florida Keys.

Cuba: Pregnant Women in Coronavirus Quarantine Denied Water,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/08/10/cuba-pregnant-women-coronavirus-quarantine-living-bats-denied-water/,08/10/21,www.breitbart.com,"A pregnant woman in Holguin, Cuba, accused the government of placing her in a Chinese coronavirus quarantine facility overrun with vermin, lacking water, and far from any health workers, the Spanish publication Diario de Cuba reported Tuesday. The woman, Yariagnis Cordero, published a commentary on Facebook on Sunday, featuring photos of the dilapidated facility, also protesting that she was assigned a bed draped in the same sheets that another patient, confirmed to be infected with coronavirus, had used before her, and that authorities had not offered any soap or hygiene products for the women there to wash their hands or shower. The quarantine facility was, according to her testimony, set apart for the exclusive use of pregnant suspected coronavirus patients. The photos show what appears to be a former, potentially abandoned dormitory packed with small metal beds. They do not show any room for the women to keep their clothes or eat and do not appear to give any of the interned privacy from each other or the authorities. Cordero also took a photo of a small, tiled space that appeared to be for toilet or bathing use, but did not feature a showerhead or actual toilet, just a drain in the corner. Me siento indignadaAyer me trajeron del Hospital Lenin para la Vocacional donde nos tienen a las embarazadas con covid.... Posted by Yariagnis Cordero on Sunday, August 8, 2021 ""I couldnt do anything but cry,"" Cordero wrote when arriving at the facility. ""They put me on the fourth floor and the doctors are on the first floor, which is to say whoever feels bad has to go down the stairs all the way to the first floor, if they make it,"" she explained. ""They put me in a bed where another positive case had been without disinfecting or cleaning the bed, I had to sleep like that."" ""I havent been able to shower yet because there is no water - a virus that requires so much hygiene and for there to be no water to even wash your hands,"" she lamented, ""living with mosquitos, frogs, bats, and even a mouse came to visit. And thats only what Ive seen in less than 24 hours of being here."" Cordero described the quarantine experience as being ""sad, embarrassing, humiliating"" and noted that Holguin did not appear to be lacking in temporary housing such that the Communist Party would need to resort to such poorly tended facilities. ""With so many hotels, visiting houses, maternities that there are in Holguin, to choose this underworld for the pregnant just shows a great lack of sensibility and respect towards such a fragile sector of society,"" she protested, concluding, ""were pregnant women, not stray dogs."" The Communist Party of Cuba largely ignored the coronavirus pandemic for much of 2020, refusing to implement social distancing measures or even offer children better access to soap and water in schools while promoting itself as an open tourist destination while much of the world locked down. Cuban citizens complained that tourists - identifiable by their more expensive clothes and poor Spanish proficiency or differing accents - appeared to be exempt from mask mandates and other protective measures. The result has been a significant surge in coronavirus cases that appears to continue reaching new heights. The Communist Partys official statistics showed 93 deaths tied to coronavirus infections on Tuesday, the last day for which full numbers are available, and 8,936 new confirmed cases. Holguin led the way with 13 deaths, followed by Guantanamo and Ciego de Avila, all eastern territories. Cumulatively, Cuba has documented over 475,000 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and 3,608 deaths. Many experts believe these official numbers are far lower than the actual case and death counts for the island since early 2020, citing the documented shortage of PCR tests used to confirm coronavirus cases and minimal access that Cubans have to any health care at all under socialism. ""There are no rapid tests, no PCR. Sick people are given [hospital] leave by sight - they see that they look a little better, look at their x-rays, and let them go,"" a doctor in central Villa Clara, commenting anonymously for fear of government retribution, told the Cuban independent outlet 14 y Medio on Monday. Reports surfaced in early 2021 that the Communist Party had begun putting together quarantine camps for suspected and confirmed coronavirus patients. Like the testimony attributed to Cordero, those who survived the camps complained of extremely unsanitary conditions and poor medical care. The independent outlet Cubanet obtained photos of a sample meal at one of the quarantine camps in Havana, showing a bit of rice, a slab of boiled yuca, two boiled eggs, onions, and what appeared to be a small piece of stale bread. o Un ejemplo de la comida que dan el centro de aislamiento de la UCI (Universidad de Ciencias Informaticas), en La Habana. pic.twitter.com/U82P3ERxC5 -- Cubanet  (@CubanetNoticias) March 5, 2021 The Global Liberty Alliance, a human rights advocacy organization, confirmed the reports in March. ""Suspected COVID [Chinese coronavirus]-positive cases are being transported to an 'isolation center, which is a minimally converted school,"" the GLA described in a report that month. ""They are isolated for 5 days, given the PCR COVID-19 test, and if tested positive, are sent to the Military Hospital. If they test negative, they must remain 5 more days before being PCR tested again."" The GLA also revealed that Communist Party officials were using untested medical treatments on both coronavirus patients and people who had not tested positive for the virus, specifically nasal interferon treatments. Interferons are antiviral proteins often used to treat cancers and various forms of hepatitis. The Castro regime has repeatedly promoted their use to treat Chinese coronavirus despite the lack of clinical data on their efficacy for that purpose. A group of doctors denounced the regimes practice in early 2020, warning that interferon use in coronavirus cases could ""kill, rather than cure"" patients. No evidence suggests that interferons can help prevent coronavirus cases in those not infected, leaving unclear the goal of the regimes policy of administering nasal interferons on some individuals who have not tested positive for the disease.

"Miami nonprofit's team of volunteer lawyers advocates for SOS Cuba detainees, prisoners",https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/08/10/miami-nonprofits-team-of-volunteer-lawyers-advocates-for-sos-cuba-detainees-prisoners/,08/10/21,www.local10.com,"MIAMI - A Miami nonprofit organization assembled a new legal team to advocate for the Cubans who continue to be punished for demonstrating against the communist-run islands government. Besieged by COVID, Cubans are facing shortages of food and medicines, intermittent power outages, repression, and death. Movimiento Democracia, or Democracy Movement, is helping to file petitions to the Organization of American States Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, on behalf of the new generation of political prisoners. The groups various efforts also include sending an envoy to the Vatican with a request to intercede. ""We are here to maintain the identity and the physical presence of those who have disappeared,"" said Augustin ""Gus"" Garcia, the co-founder of the Democracy Movement. Santiago Alpizar, who has practiced law on the island and Florida; Nicolas J. Gutierrez, the former chairman of the South Florida Water Management District, and Edgar Mili met with the leaders of the Democracy Movement during a news conference at the Rivero/Mestre Law Firm in Coral Gables. Ad Alpizar, who was born in Placetas, Cuba, has law degrees from the Central University ""Marta Abreu"" of Las Villas and the Florida Coastal School of Law. He said that under the new Cuban Constitution every Cuban who is living outside of the island has the right to present petitions to ""the powers of the State"" and there have been about 2,015 so far this year. Garcia and Ramon Saul Sanchez, the Cuban exiled leader of the Democracy Movement, announced the team of 23 lawyers is the largest since the organizations inception in the 1990s. Sanchez said its also the beginning of an ambitious humanitarian plan for more volunteers to step in ""when the collapse of the dictatorship begins"" in order to help avoid chaos. ""We are here not just to shout Cuba Libre, but to make Cuba Libre,"" Garcia said. Ramon Saul Sanchez, the Cuban exiled leader of the Democracy Movement, talks to reporters during a news conference on Tuesday at the Rivero/Mestre Law Firm in Coral Gables. (Copyright 2020 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.) Sanchez said the call to join the effort is urgent. He said he is worried about the wellbeing of two Cuban dissidents: Jose Daniel Ferrer, 51, of Palma Soriano, a city in the Santiago de Cuba province, and Felix Navarro, 68, of Perico, a city in the Matanzas province. Ad ""Those who are inside Cuba are being repressed, some of them are incommunicado, or unaccounted for,"" Sanchez said. ""Some of them have been killed in very grotesque manners."" Despite witnesses who had videos alleging otherwise, the Cuban government denied there were reports of arbitrary arrests, police brutality, or extrajudicial killings. Officials on state-run television questioned the reliability of reports from human rights organizations on the number of SOS Cuba protesters arrested. Cubalex, a nongovernmental organization based in the U.S., estimates 770 people were arrested in connection to the July protests and 550 are in prison. Garcia said some of them are Cubans with dual nationalities from Spain and Italy. ARRESTS CONTINUE Human rights activists reported summary trials and arrests related to demands for political change continued this month. Cuban officers arrested Ruhama Fernandez, a YouTube influencer from the Cuban city of Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, Cubalex reported on Tuesday. Ad Cubalex, a nongovernmental organization based in the U.S., reported on Tuesday Cuban officers arrested Ruhama Fernandez, a YouTube influencer also known as ""ruhsantiago."" (YouTube Ruhama Fernandez and Google Maps) The 22-year-old dissident has said her parents live in the United States, Communist Party members dont allow her to get a college education, to travel out of the island, and regularly harass her. ""It is very exhausting and that is why we need freedom because I do not want my children to have this fight tomorrow,"" Fernandez said in one of her recent videos in Spanish. On Monday, Fernandez published a brazen ""Do not insult our intelligence"" editorial to criticize Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, his ""damn socialism"" and the biased treatment of pro-government demonstrations during the pandemic. On Sunday, she published ""Santiago took to the streets and this is how I lived it."" Ad ""We did not vandalize ... We absolutely did not hit anyone. On the contrary, we were beaten and we were repressed,"" Fernandez said, adding she felt ill during a march on July 11 in Palma Soriano. AFTERMATH OF PROTESTS In response to the SOS Cuba protests and the Cuban governments crackdown, President Joe Biden added more sanctions to the ones former President Donald Trump imposed. His administration promised to find ways to circumvent the Cuban government to provide uncensored internet service and a system for remittances, money sent by U.S. relatives to Cuba. Officials in Cuba started to allow travelers to bring food and medicine without paying import duties, legalized enterprises with up to 100 employees and pushed a vaccination campaign with the Abdala and Soberana 2 vaccines. Mexico, Canada, Bolivia, and a few activists in the U.S. sent aid, including boxes of syringes. Ad Sanchez is among the Cuban exiles who dont think any of this is enough. They want communism eradicated from Cuba and for Biden to have a more aggressive intervention to make that happen. The Democracy Movements new legal team also counts on William Sanchez, an attorney who is not related to Sanchez. He has an immigration practice in Miami-Dade County and wants to run against Sen. Marco Rubio next year. For more information about how to join the effort, contact the members of the Democracy Movement at movimientodemocracia@gmail.com.

She explained that Cuban law allows for such swift disposition of cases involving purportedly minor crimes, where the punishment is less than one year in prison. ""They are making what we call 'exemplary trials, with many people who are being prosecuted without evidence,"" she said. ""Many defendants dont have lawyers, they [the authorities] dont allow their relatives in court or their relatives are not notified,"" Cantera added. ""In some cases, the relatives were told the trial would be held at a certain place and when they arrived, it turned out the trial was being held elsewhere, they arrived late and therefore couldnt enter.

""Many lawyers are recommending to the relatives not to divulge the cases on social networks, not to make the case visible, not to talk to the independent press, not to talk to the foreign press,"" she said, adding that ""some have even told them not to go through an appeal process because the penalty may be higher."" ""There is also a lack of legal culture in Cuba,"" she went on, ""and right now it puts many families in a very vulnerable situation."" In an effort to break the code of silence, Cantera and other independent journalists and activists are working to catalogue information about their arrested compatriots. As of late Tuesday, a Google document contained the names of 805 people who had been arrested or are otherwise unaccounted for in the aftermath of the demonstrations, the intensity of which Cantera described as unprecedented since the ascension of Fidel Castro to power in 1959. The list has been slowly built out despite the best efforts of the Cuban government to limit the spread of information about their actions. ""You have to realize that all this is functionally illegal and blocked by the Cuban government, so theyre trying to hack it as best they can while some among them are getting detained, disappeared, etc. and the internet is shutting off all the time,"" said author Antonio Garcia Martinez, who shared the list with The Post. ""So, its a scramble on their side."" Glenda Marrero Matanzas The document, which is entitled ""List of detainees and disappeared Cuba July 2021,"" includes each persons name, the place they were last seen, the time and date of their detention if known, the latest report on their status and their age if known. Only a select few can update the document, in order to prevent pro-regime propagandists from deleting the information or spreading falsehoods. The youngest person on the list is 14-year-old Christopher Lleonart Santana of Havana. At last report, he was arrested July 17 at 3 a.m., accused of throwing stones and held in a detention center for minors. ""His mother reports that he has been beaten,"" the document reads. Another name on the list is 15-year-old Glenda de la Caridad Marrero Cartaya, described as a computer student accused of ""inciting riots"" in the town of Jovellanos, about 100 miles east of Havana. She faces up to 60 days in prison. Nearly two dozen people on the list have already been tried and sentenced to between 8 and 12 months in prison. One of them is 17-year-old Katherine Martin, who was arrested along with her mother and her sister Miriam. The document records that Katherine was sentenced to a year in prison after a summary trial on July 20 and was ""badly beaten"" while in jail. Anyelo Troya ""Katty is a very brave girl,"" the document records the testimony of a fellow detainee. ""We called her 'The Colombian because she imitates the Colombian accent to perfection and made us laugh a lot. Katty is only 17 and has had to live in prison because she doesnt agree, because she doesnt conform."" Katherines mother, Myra Taquechel, has been sentenced to eight months in prison while sister Miriam has been released on bail. Another name on the list, 25-year-old photographer old Angelo Troya, was given a year in prison for filming the protests, according to independent journalist Claudia Padron Cueto. ""Angelo went out to film the protests, to document them. Only that,"" Cueto tweeted July 21. ""They did not forgive him for filming ... They did not forgive him for filming the demonstrations and repression"". The oldest person on the list is 68-year-old Felix Navarro Rodriguez, who was reportedly arrested and charged with public disorder while inquiring about other detainees the day after the protests in the city of Matanzas, 55 miles east of Havana. ""The list is based on reports from family members and friends,"" Cantera explained. ""Theyre either public reports that are posted on social networks or from people who contact us through our internal channels and ask us to please add their family member to the list, who believe that it is necessary for them to be there to make that case visible, so we do it."" Once a person is reported detained, Cantera says, a group of women is tasked with verifying they actually have lost their freedom. ""They contact other family members, other friends, they check Facebook, they check social media pages to confirm the last time they posted, what has been known about that person, what has been published about that person, they contact other family members and friends to verify in fact that the information reported is real,"" she said. ""This process is quite slow compared to the number of reports that come in, because there are other relatives who do not want to talk, relatives who are afraid."" Cantera adds that regular internet outages, which she calls ""a government tool for censorship"", also make the verification process slow going, but ""we hope at some point to get to verify all of them."" Felix Navarro Rodriguez Of the 805 detainees, 373 are confirmed as being detained at a known location. A further 248 are listed as ""En excarcelacion"" or released, though activists say that number includes people who are under house arrest. A further 173 people described as being ""en proceso de verificacion,"" meaning their current whereabouts are unknown. The vast majority in this category have been reported detained in connection with the protests, while some are described as having been caught up in ""criminal investigations."" Ominously, 39 people included on the list are confirmed or suspected of being ""desapariciones forzadas"" -- forced disappearances. ""The people who are in enforced disappearance are people whose whereabouts are still unknown,"" Cantera says. ""That means that that person has not been allowed to make a call, or that person is detained in a place and we dont know where they are because he or she does not appear in the records ... We are not trying to say that these people have died, [but] they are people whom to this day we do not know where they are."" The Cuban government has remained tight-lipped about the exact numbers of people who have been detained, missing or charged following the protests. The regime did disclose that one person had died as a result of the protests, but the opposition group Cuba Decide estimate the number of deaths is at least five. Havana has also blamed the protests on supposed agitators from the Cuban diaspora in South Florida, as well as the US government. While the list of detainees includes opposition activists, others are described as ""unemployed"" or ""housewife"". Katherine Martin is listed as a ""student and model"", while her sister Miriam is described as a manicurist. The efforts of Cantera and her cohorts have drawn the attention of Cubas security state. While neither she nor her colleagues have been detained or arrested, Cantera told The Post that one of the ""verification girls,"" as she calls them, has been placed under police surveillance. ""What they do is that they put a police patrol outside her house and dont let her out, and that person is still under police surveillance to this day,"" she said. ""We also know that some officers have been visiting some of the detainees who have already been released, asking them about lists, we know that in some interrogations of detainees inside the facilities, they asked about the list, and who was making the list. Mayra Taquechel ""So we know that, yes, it is a subject that has come out of the interrogations; but, well, to this day none of us has been detained or called for a summons, nor have we been summoned for this work,"" Cantera added, saying that such a summons was ""something that we do not rule out happening at some point, either."" Meanwhile, the Cuban regime has sought to loosen restrictions in an effort to tamp down public unrest. Three days after the protests, the government announced it was lifting caps on the amount of food and medicine travelers could bring into the country, a move Cantera called ""a small Band-Aid for all the problems we have here."" ""The Government of Cuba is denying access to human rights observers and is counting on the world to turn a blind eye to its repression. But we will not look away. This is repression,"" a State Department spokesperson told The Post Tuesday. ""We join the families who are suffering and scared, Cubas human rights defenders, and people around the world in calling for the immediate release of all those detained or missing for merely exercising their human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and demanding freedom. We are also joining efforts to catalogue and raise awareness about specific instances of abuses against peaceful protestors. Katerine Martin ""Violence and detentions of Cuban protesters and missing independent activists remind us that Cubans pay dearly for freedom and dignity,"" the spokesperson added. ""We call for the immediate release of those wrongfully detained."" The Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC, did not return requests for comment by The Post. One month after the July 11 protests, Cantera says the overwhelming feeling in Cuba is ""a lot of fear"" among people who worry about the consequences of speaking out. ""I have a friend who had never had any kind of behavior on social networks and she posted something, as she was quite outraged about what had happened,"" she recounted. ""But afterwards, she was very afraid of having written that, in fear for her own well-being and that of her family. So, there is fear even of writing a post on Facebook."" Cantera said her friends fears were well-founded, as the Cuban government has gotten into the habit of checking peoples Facebook pages in order to ascertain their ""social and moral behavior"" during the protests and their aftermath. ""One of the things everybody thought after July 11 was that that would be it, that the government was going to come to its end, that the totalitarian system was going to fall,"" she says. ""But the reality is that days have gone by and that, well, has not happened and I dont believe that it will happen as soon as we were expecting it to."" Meanwhile, those who took part in the protests, were arrested, and were either released on bail or to house arrest, have suffered what Cantera calls ""a terrible trauma from the violence they experienced, either in the protests or in the prisons and in the police stations. ""So, there is a terrible fear,"" she said.",

"One month after Cuba protests, hundreds remain behind bars",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/one-month-after-cuba-protests-hundreds-remain-behind-bars-2021-08-12/,08/12/21,www.reuters.com,"Gabriela Sequeira Hernandez, 17, detained by police during a protest and waiting for her appeal after being convicted and sentenced to 8 months home arrest, holds her mother's hand during an interview in Havana, Cuba, August 10, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people, including dozens of dissident artists and opposition activists, remain detained in Communist-run Cuba a month after unprecedented anti-government protests, according to rights groups. Thousands took to the streets nationwide on July 11 to protest a dire economic crisis and curbs on civil rights. The government said the unrest was fomented by counter-revolutionaries exploiting hardship caused largely by U.S. sanctions. Rights group Cubalex has recorded around 800 detentions, a number that has risen daily as relatives come forward. Many are still too afraid to report the arrest of family members, said Cubalex director Laritza Diversent. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register While 249 people have been released, many to house arrest, most remain in ""preventative jail,"" she said. The whereabouts of 10 people is unknown. Dozens have already been sentenced to up to a year in prison or correctional work in summary trials, with simplified procedures and often without the chance of hiring a defense lawyer on time, said Diversent. ""The government's aim is to make an example of those who protested, to stop others from doing the same,"" she said. The government did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Cuban authorities have not given a figure for the total number of detained in the recent unrest but say they have so far carried out trials for 62 people, 22 of which had hired a lawyer. All but one have been deemed guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest, and vandalism, they said. The protests were largely peaceful, although state media showed some demonstrators looting and throwing stones at police. One person died and several people, including government supporters, were injured, authorities have confirmed. Several of those sentenced were not protesting, but were caught up in the unrest, according to their relatives. Yaquelin Salas, 35, says her husband intervened peacefully in the arrest of a woman, calling on police agents to not treat her so aggressively. Now he is serving a 10-month prison sentence on charges of public disorder after a collective trial in which just two of the 12 detained had lawyers. ""What they are doing is totally unfair,"" said Salas. Since Cuba's 1959 revolution, authorities have tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by the United States, which has long openly sought to force political change through sanctions and democracy initiatives. The White House has said it will do what it can to support Cuban protesters. FAMILIES 'SILENCED' Gabriela Zequeira, 17, one of several minors detained in the protests, said she was sentenced to house arrest for eight months after being arrested while walking home from the hairdressers on July 11. Upon her admission to jail, where she was kept 10 days incommunicado, she said she was required to put a finger in her vagina to show she was concealing nothing as part of a strip search. Officers kept interrupting her attempts to sleep and one officer made sexual taunts, she said in an interview. The Cuban government initially said no minors had been detained, a statement later contradicted by state prosecutors. Some relatives of those detained said authorities were pressuring them to stop speaking out. ""My family has been silenced,"" said emigre Milagros Beirut from her home in Spain. She said four of her relatives in Havana and the eastern city of Guantanamo remained behind bars for protesting peacefully. ""They've been told those detained will receive a stricter sentence if they say anything."" Dozens of political activists and dissident artists were among the detained, including some who did not participate in the protests but appeared to have been arrested pre-emptively, said Diversent from Cubalex. Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of Cuba's largest opposition group, and Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, head of a dissident artists collective, were both arrested on their way to the protests before even arriving, according to their supporters. Ferrer's sister Ana Belkis Ferrer said the family had not been able to speak to or see him, a complaint of many relatives of those detained. ""We don't know if he's being beaten, if he's well or not, whether or not he's doing a hunger strike,"" she said. Another detained activist, Felix Navarro, 68, president of the Party for Democracy, was in hospital with COVID-19, said Diversent. Several of those detained have denounced unsanitary conditions in jail amid one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the world.

He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns.

The decrees published in the Official Gazette follow the largest protests Cuba has seen in years, which broke out last month and apparently were fed in part by messages on social media applications. A decree signed by Communications Minister Mayra Arevich was meant to ""prevent, detect and respond opportunely to possible enemy, criminal and harmful activities that could occur in cyberspace."" It forbids spreading content that attacks ""the constitutional, social and economic"" rules of the state or that incite demonstrations or other acts ""that alter public order."" It also targets messages that justify violence or that affect peoples privacy or dignity. The decree also bans ""cyberterrorism"" aimed at subverting order or destabilizing the country, categorizing it as a crime of ""very high"" danger. ADVERTISEMENT It did not specify penalties, which are to be set in legislation later. But if offered a model form that people can fill out to denounce ""cybersecurity incidents."" Thousands of Cubans took part in protests on July 11 and 12, angered by shortages of food and medicine and by power outages, as well as some demanding more political freedom. The government accused outside groups and the U.S. government of using social media to cause trouble, and arrested numerous people -- officials have not given numbers -- as well as limiting access to the internet and temporarily cutting off access to cellphone data plans. While the new decree specifically deals with actions on the internet, Cuba already has laws that punish people for actions and statements that undermine its socialist system. The gazette also published rule against providing telecommunications services without official authorization, setting fines ranging from the equivalent of $800 to $1,600. In the past, the government often has cracked down on people who used clandestine satellite television dishes and decoders to pick up TV signals from the United States. In the wake of the protests, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said it is studying ways to give Cubans independent access to the internet. Republican critics have criticized Biden for not acting more quickly.",

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Several doctors in Cuba have taken to social media to decry shortages of medicine, oxygen and other materials needed to battle a dire COVID-19 outbreak, in a rare public denunciation of conditions in the island's hallowed healthcare system. The outcry comes in reaction to comments by government officials that the doctors say scapegoat medics for the country's worsening plight while downplaying precarious conditions pre-dating the current crisis. ""I want to denounce the collapse of our health system in our hospital as well as in the rest of the country, due to a lack of resources and protective gear,"" said Dr. Francisco Pavon in a video shared on social media, featuring more than 20 doctors and medical students in the eastern province of Holguin. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Others took to Facebook or messaging platforms to denounce the critical situation and demand more support from authorities. Similar criticism has been seen elsewhere globally during the pandemic as medical staff have reached a breaking point when infections have ballooned, overwhelming even the richest of healthcare systems. But in Cuba it is unusual, as authorities often restrict public dissent, saying unity is necessary to combat open U.S. attempts to force political change. And the topic is especially sensitive: healthcare is considered one of the pillars of legitimacy of Cuba's ""revolutionary"" one-party system, having produced results on a par with rich nations. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged last week the healthcare system was overwhelmed. Cuba currently has one of the highest caseloads worldwide. The government has blamed tougher U.S. sanctions for worsening shortages on the island and slowing the roll-out of home-grown vaccines. But doctors' complaints have exposed simmering resentment over how rundown Cuba's healthcare system was even before the pandemic, with many blaming economic mismanagement not U.S. sanctions, as well as low salaries and other labor issues. Coming a month after unprecedented nationwide anti-government protests, rights activists say it is another sign Cubans are losing their fear of speaking up despite the risk of reprisals, like losing their job or being expelled from university. The growth of internet access in Cuba, providing virtual forums to share gripes and mobilize, has been key, they say. Diaz-Canel blamed last month's protests on the United States, accusing Washington of fomenting dissent online. But he also signaled he was open to reforms and a re-evaluation of Cuba's economic policies. 'SHAME ON YOU' While state-run media have published few details of Cuba's COVID-19 crisis, reports of incinerators breaking down due to excess corpses or deaths due to a lack of oxygen have been emerging in provincial outlets in the worst-affected provinces and on social media. But Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said he had heard more complaints during a visit to the central province of Cienfuegos about ""mistreatment and neglect"" by doctors than about scarcity. That, and statements by other officials alluding to doctors not showing up at their clinics or taking holidays in the middle of the crisis, proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back for many overworked doctors. ""Shame on you for criticizing those on the front lines,"" wrote Marian Vasquez, 23, a doctor and trainee-surgeon at the main Cienfuegos hospital, on Facebook. ""It's time you did more and criticized and lied less."" The country has long prided itself on having one of the highest ratios of physicians per capita, but many are deployed overseas. Now, the country is bringing hundreds back. ""Why the closed door meetings. Why did you not meet and dialogue with those on the ground?"" asked Miguel Angel Gonzalez, a doctor in Cienfuegos, chiming in with growing accusations among Cubans that government officials are out of touch with the people. He said the medics had hoped officials might be able to explain how they were supposed to work without enough equipment to do chest x-rays for all the patients in intensive therapy or the reactives to conduct basic tests. Government officials this week moved into damage control mode, underscoring their gratitude for the work of doctors and their efforts to increase oxygen supplies. ""What we have most proven in this time is the patriotism of our people, the healthcare staff, scientists. Working full time in complicated situations,"" wrote the president on Twitter. ""Thanks to all!"" Wearing a white doctor's coat, stethoscope around his neck and face mask, one doctor in the video, Rafael Alejandro Fuentes, said he was afraid, not of the pandemic, but of how government would interpret them ""demanding (their) rights."" State media said on Tuesday Cuba was updating its telecoms legislation to outlaw certain behavior on social media like publishing ""false news, offensive messages or defamation with impact on the country's prestige."" Cuba says it has the right to defend itself against U.S.-backed counterrevolutionaries seeking to overthrow it. However, some doctors saw this as an attempt to muzzle them and other critics. Access to internet and social media was also heavily disrupted in the weeks following the July 11 protests. ""We could not speak in public spaces,"" said one doctor working at a COVID-19 isolation center, on condition of anonymity. ""Now we can't do it over the internet.""

"New Cuban decree tightens controls on social media, sparking outrage",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/new-cuban-decree-tightens-controls-social-media-sparking-outrage-2021-08-18/,08/18/21,www.reuters.com,"HAVANA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Cuba introduced tighter controls on the use of social media this week, including a ban on publications that might damage ""the country's prestige,"" angering many citizens and international rights activists. Decree 35, published in the official gazette on Tuesday, comes a month after the most widespread anti-government protests in the Communist-run country in decades, which spread in part due to information shared on social media. The legislation bans the spread of false news or messages and content deemed offensive or which ""incite mobilizations or other acts that upset public order."" It also provides a channel for Cubans to inform on potential contraventions.

It does not say what the penalties will be for violations. ""Our Decree 35 goes against misinformation and cyber lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who has blamed the July 11 protests on an online campaign by U.S.-backed counter-revolutionaries. Cuba analysts compared the measure to the totalitarianism of George Orwell's ""1984"", saying that they feared the vague definitions of what constitutes a violation would allow for arbitrary implementation. Since the introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago, platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp have enabled Cubans to share their gripes and even mobilize in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled. ""Cuba is formalizing digital repression,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty's Americas director, noting the state already had monopoly over internet access, which was curtailed during and following the July 11 protests. Nicaragua passed similar ""cyber crime"" legislation last year and has used it to muzzle opposition, she said. Cuba's new decree explicitly orders the state telecoms monopoly to suspend services to users who have committed contraventions, in coordination with relevant authorities. 1/4 People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021.

Canada-based Cuban legal analyst Eloy Viera said Decree 35 outlined regulations rather than updated the penal code, so would not result in jailtime for those found transgressing. But it was a more severe and explicitly political measure to regulate online expression than a previous, 2019 decree that bans the ""spreading of information contrary to the common good, morals, decency, and integrity,"" he said. Government critics have faced fines under that decree, said Viera. But ultimately it had not been effective and neither, likely, would Decree 35, he said. ""They won't be able to apply it to all the discontent of Cubans, who have found in social media a space that does not exist in the country's public places,"" said Viera.

Several Cuban doctors use social media to protest conditions during coronavirus pandemic,https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/08/18/several-cuban-doctors-use-social-media-to-protest-conditions-during-coronavirus-pandemic/,08/18/21,www.local10.com,"MIAMI - Several overworked Cuban doctors and medical students used social media to protest the lack of resources available during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Miguel Angel Gonzalez Suarez, who works at a hospital in Cubas Cienfuegos province used Facebook to report his disappointment with a recent visit by government officials and the lack of solutions to be able to ""ensure"" the adequate care"" of patients. ""We keep working without medicines. I dont stop to quote them because the list would be extensive, just remember that today it was the cause of death in our center,"" Gonzalez Suarez wrote in Spanish, adding that ""the health sector is tired, exhausted, and mostly disappointed."" Cuban officials televised statements havent offered any solutions. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel acknowledged on Monday that oxygen supplies for COVID patients are running low and asked doctors around the country to limit its use. Ad Although Diaz-Canel has admitted the demands of the pandemic far exceed the capacity of the health care system, Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said on Aug. 10 that there were more complaints about doctors poor service than about shortages. Students at the Universidad de Ciencias Medicas de Holguin are trying to come up with solutions. Ramon Villamil used Facebook to announce the inception of an apolitical group of volunteers who are visiting people who are ill at home.

The decrees published in the Official Gazette follow the largest protests Cuba has seen in years, which broke out last month and apparently were fed in part by messages on social media applications. A decree signed by Communications Minister Mayra Arevich was meant to ""prevent, detect and respond opportunely to possible enemy, criminal and harmful activities that could occur in cyberspace."" It forbids spreading content that attacks ""the constitutional, social and economic"" rules of the state or that incite demonstrations or other acts ""that alter public order."" It also targets messages that justify violence or that affect peoples privacy or dignity. The decree also bans ""cyberterrorism"" aimed at subverting order or destabilizing the country, categorizing it as a crime of ""very high"" danger. It did not specify penalties, which are to be set in legislation later. But if offered a model form that people can fill out to denounce ""cybersecurity incidents."" Thousands of Cubans took part in protests on July 11 and 12, angered by shortages of food and medicine and by power outages, as well as some demanding more political freedom. The government accused outside groups and the U.S. government of using social media to cause trouble, and arrested numerous people -- officials have not given numbers -- as well as limiting access to the internet and temporarily cutting off access to cellphone data plans. While the new decree specifically deals with actions on the internet, Cuba already has laws that punish people for actions and statements that undermine its socialist system. The gazette also published rule against providing telecommunications services without official authorization, setting fines ranging from the equivalent of $800 to $1,600. In the past, the government often has cracked down on people who used clandestine satellite television dishes and decoders to pick up TV signals from the United States. In the wake of the protests, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said it is studying ways to give Cubans independent access to the internet.

Cuba says the U.S. embargo is 'genocidal.' What does it really do?,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-says-us-embargo-genocidal-really-rcna1733,08/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"Following historic protests in Cuba where thousands took to the streets, Cuban officials have repeatedly blamed the six-decade U.S. embargo for Cubas food, fuel and medicine shortages. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cuba health officials insist the embargo limits the import of crucial vaccine components -- the communist country has produced its own Covid-19 vaccines -- as well as components for medical equipment such as respirators. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has said the embargo is ""genocidal"" and calls it U.S. ""politics of economic asphyxiation."" Although the U.S. can export food, medicine and medical supplies to Cuba, the embargo makes it more difficult. The United Nations and human rights groups have called for an end to the embargo; in the U.S., its a constant topic of debate when it comes to U.S.-Cuba policy. When the embargo was fully implemented in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy, there was no trade. It was initially a response to Fidel Castros confiscation of American businesses and properties on the island following the 1959 revolution, which was the largest expropriation of U.S. assets ever. There are 5,913 unresolved certified claims -- totaling $1.9 billion at the time -- made by American citizens. Over the years, the U.S. has added more laws on the embargo, making it harsher -- while also creating more exceptions. Its now a complex set of laws with many layers. ""The embargo has more holes than Swiss cheese,"" said Pedro Freyre, chair of Akermans International Practice, which provides legal counsel to U.S.-based companies affected by the embargo. While food from the U.S. is available for export to Cuba, those who want to sell to the island requires authorizations or licenses from the Treasury and Commerce Departments, which makes it more cumbersome. Sending medicine and medical supplies from the U.S. to Cuba is trickier because they cannot be exported if there is a ""reasonable likelihood"" the product could be used for torture, re-export or the production of Cuba's biotechnological industry. It must be verified on-site that the products are being used for their intended purposes. The State Department said it regularly authorizes the export of agricultural products, medicine and medical equipment, as well as humanitarian goods, to Cuba. In the first six months of 2021, Cuba imported $123 million worth of chicken from the U.S. The majority of the exports are in the agricultural sector and include chicken, soybeans and corn. In 2007, the U.S. was among Cubas top five trading partners, and in 2008, U.S. exports of agricultural products to Cuba peaked at $684 million. That number has gone down since then as Cuba has diversified its supplier network, according to some experts. The embargo does not prevent other countries from trading with Cuba, but if a product contains 10 percent of American-created content, then it must get a license from the U.S. to be exported to Cuba. ""When you take global supply chains into consideration, that significantly limits the amount of products that can be exported to Cuba, even from third countries,"" said Ric Herrero, executive director of the pro-engagement Cuba Study Group. Other countries may fear investing and trading with a heavily sanctioned country that is also on the U.S. State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Because the embargo does not allow Cuba to obtain financing by U.S. companies, Cuba has to pay for imports with hard currency. Banks in other countries often avoid doing business with Cuba, not only because of the complexity of the U.S. sanctions but also because Cuba ""does not have a very good payment record,"" Freyre said. Cuba has defaulted on billions of dollars' worth of loans. ""The Cuban economy is so small and conditions are so difficult that its just not a very attractive market,"" said Freyre, who noted that Cuba's centralized, Marxist economy is the main reason for its poverty. After Kennedy imposed the embargo, relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union strengthened, eventually leading to the Cuban missile crisis. For decades, the Soviet Union heavily subsidized Cuba and accounted for 80 percent of Cubas international trade. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it sent Cuba into a deep economic crisis it has never really recovered from. It was during this period that the U.S. passed the Cuban Democracy Act, which strengthened the embargo and constrained presidential power, stating it could only be lifted if the president reports to Congress that Cuba has met a series of conditions, including free and fair elections. The CDA allowed the export of medicines and medical supplies for humanitarian reasons. It also banned vessels that enter Cuba for trade from loading or unloading in the U.S. within 180 days after leaving Cuba, unless authorized by OFAC -- making it more expensive to send shipments. The next phase of the embargo came in 1996 with the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. It was signed into law weeks after Cuban MiG fighters shot down two planes belonging to the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue, killing four people. ""That gave the impetus for Congress to act,"" said Herrero. ""It was an election year, and President Bill Clinton wanted to lock in Florida."" The Helms-Burton Act made it harder to lift the embargo by making the existing laws and regulations permanent unless lifted by Congress or if an expanded series of conditions are met by Cuba, including ""a transition government."" It also allowed the original owners of Cuban properties confiscated by Castro to sue in U.S. courts foreign companies that were using them for business, though this part of the law was not enacted until 2019 by President Donald Trump. A subsequent U.S. law enacted in 2000, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, allowed the direct sale of agricultural products and other food to Cuba. Jason Poblete, a Washington, D.C., attorney who supports sanctions on Cuba, said while ""the measure makes it easier to export food and medicine,"" it ""adds more steps not otherwise needed when exporting to a nonsanctioned country."" During the Obama years, restrictions were eased on U.S.-Cuba trade, financial transactions and travel, but Trump reversed much of them. After six decades, even some who support sanctions on Cuba say it's undeniable that the embargo has mainly been about domestic politics. ""Sanctions are a tool, not a policy,"" Poblete said. ""All sides should agree on this, but folks keep talking past one another without focusing on achievable solutions."" Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
"'Living through a war': In Cuba, a race to vaccinate as Covid surges",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/living-war-cuba-race-vaccinate-covid-surges-rcna1635,08/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"HAVANA -- Niurka Rodriguez is besieged by Covid-19. Across the road, a famous pitcher who played baseball for her province, Ciego de Avila, recently died after contracting the virus. Many of her neighbors are infected, and her local clinic has no rapid tests. ""Were living through a war,"" said Rodriguez, 57, a homemaker. Over the last month, daily case numbers in the communist-ruled island have tripled as the delta variant of the coronavirus has taken root. While total daily case numbers remain under 10,000, the country now has the highest contagion rate per capita in Latin America, although the mortality rate remains well below the regional and world averages. The central province of Ciego de Avila, where Rodriguez lives, is the current hot spot. With the local health care system overwhelmed, the government last week converted two of 30 hotels in the province into hospitals. Two hundred Cuban doctors were also withdrawn from posts in Venezuela to treat the surge in cases. ""These are good decisions, but they could have been taken earlier,"" Rodriguez said. ""The local [Communist] Party has been badly organized."" Government leaders agree. ""We neednt be embarrassed that [the virus] has exceeded the capacities of our institutions -- this has happened around the world,"" Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said last week. ""But we ought to be embarrassed when ... effects are increased by our shoddy work, our negligence and our errors."" Such pointed self-criticism from the government is rare. The change in language reflects a deteriorating situation on the ground, as well as, perhaps, an attempt to chime with popular discontent following unprecedented anti-government protests last month. Throughout last year the island, which touts its status as the country with the highest doctor-to-patient ratio, implemented a successful track, trace and isolation regimen. All positive patients were hospitalized, including asymptomatic patients. Cuba's government reported that just 146 people died from the virus last year, the equivalent of 13 deaths per million throughout the year (the U.S. recorded 1,024 deaths per million over the same period). But last week alone, the death toll was 602. The country is getting humanitarian assistance. Last week, ships bearing oxygen from Mexico, syringes from Bolivia and rice from Vietnam docked on the islands shores. Canada donated over a million tablets of dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drug. Meanwhile, groups in the U.S. including the Saving Lives Campaign and CODEPINK teamed up under Global Health Partners and raised over $500,000 for syringes for the island. Two million syringes from the U.S. arrived last month. 'Health workers can't be defeatist' In the midst of it all, the countrys overworked, underpaid doctors trundle on. ""Health workers cant be defeatist,"" said Dr. Santos Huete, who earns the equivalent of $105 a month working in a hospital in Havana. He has not had a day off since the pandemic began. ""Weve had so much work we havent been able to fall into depression,"" he joked. Dr. Maritza Damera, 50, a physician, came down with a relatively light case of Covid last week. With the country aligning its protocols with the international norm of hospitalizing only serious cases because of high case numbers, she is quarantining at home. ""Health workers are giving their all, but they do not have enough personal protective equipment,"" she said. In the stress and uncertainty, Damera has been brought to tears by the compassion of those around her. ""Friends have brought me antibiotics, steroids, chicken and gelatine,"" she said. ""Despite the circumstances, Cubans have not lost their humanity."" Opting to develop its own vaccines rather than import, Cuba got out of the starting blocks later than many other countries in the region. Cuban regulators approved the homegrown Abdala vaccine for emergency use last month, making Cuba the first Latin American country to develop a successful Covid vaccine. Phase 3 clinical trials of Abdala and Soberana 2, the other Cuban vaccine, reported over 90 percent efficacy rates. But international health organizations have urged Cuba to publish trial data in peer-reviewed scientific journals so the efficacy can be evaluated by global scientists. Twenty-five percent of Cubans have been fully vaccinated, while 42 percent have received at least one dose. Both figures are above the Latin American average (22 percent fully vaccinated, 24 percent partly vaccinated). But statistics matter little to those still waiting as the death toll rises. Sanctions blamed for slower vaccine rollout In this race against time, Cuban scientists say U.S. sanctions on the island have slowed the rollout of the vaccines. Of the two Cuban vaccines, state media initially heavily promoted Soberana 2. Yet far more Cubans have been vaccinated with the other vaccine, Abdala. Vicente Verez, Soberana 2s lead developer, said the manufacturer had to slow vaccine production, because it didn't have all the necessary components. ""Businesses which have traded with Cuba for decades suddenly told us they can no longer continue,"" Verez said, declining to give details, citing security concerns. ""If I specified, Id be giving them [the U.S. government] exactly the information they need to put their finger in the wound."" Earlier in the pandemic, two Swiss companies that had previously sold Cuba ventilators said they could no longer continue trading with the island after they were bought out by Vyaire Medical, an Illinois company. ""The U.S. pays lip service to the idea that medicines can be sent to Cuba,"" said Dr. Mitchell Valdes-Sosa, a member of Cubas Coronavirus Task Force. ""But theres an explicit prohibition of anything being exported to Cuba that can be used for biotech. That includes vaccines."" Valdes-Sosa cited the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, still in force, which states: ""Exports of medicines or medical supplies, instruments, or equipment to Cuba shall not be restricted ... except in a case in which the item to be exported could be used in the production of any biotechnological product."" The 62-year embargo was supercharged under the Trump administration's over 200 sanctions. Even though President Joe Biden campaigned to ease them, the administration has so far left the Trump-era sanctions in place. The administration earmarked the island as a low priority in its early months, but in light of the protests, it recently sanctioned several officials over human rights abuses and is expected to announce new measures. The Cuban Neuroscience Center, which Valdes-Sosa directs, has manufactured 164 Cuban-designed ventilators since the pandemic began. It suffers intermittent power outages. ""Our biotech industry is working under conditions of limitations,"" he said. ""We make a great effort not to go over the electricity quota, because we know it will affect the population."" Ramping up shots Verez, the vaccine developer, said that sourcing problems for the Soberana 2 vaccine have been resolved and that over the last few weeks production has been ramped up to industrial scale. Vaccination is now going at a faster clip: Around 1 percent of the population is being vaccinated daily, and the Public Health Ministry says it is on track to have 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the end of the month. While the recent news that the majority of new Covid cases in Havana are among those who are vaccinated has caused concern, scientists emphasize that the capitals vaccination campaign finished only last week and that time is required for the vaccines to take full effect. The Public Health Ministry published promising data indicating that from June to July, the death rate of those who contracted the virus more than halved in the parts of Havana where the vaccination campaign began. The hope is that the picture will extend to the provinces in the coming weeks and that there will be a reduction in the death count, followed by lower caseloads. For Huete, the upbeat doctor, hope is the only option. ""We have to think were going to triumph and see the light."" Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
"As Biden takes steps on Cuba policy, some Cuban Americans say they want to see more forceful actions",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/biden-takes-steps-cuba-policy-cuban-americans-say-want-see-forceful-ac-rcna1595,08/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"MIAMI -- Belkis Gutierrez, 54, is constantly on her phone looking at videos from Cuba that show people's discontent with the government following the historic protests that rocked the communist island several weeks ago. Gutierrez, who supported President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, said she wants to see more bold action from the administration toward Cuba following the arrests of protesters and worries over food shortages and rising Covid-19 cases. ""I was expecting something more forceful than just sanctioning Cuban officials who dont travel to the U.S. anyway,"" said Gutierrez, who left Cuba two decades ago and has close relatives on the island. Asked what she would prefer, Gutierrez said Biden should build an international coalition that can travel to Cuba and hold a dialogue with the government to demand concrete changes from them. Many Cuban Americans want to see bolder action against the Cuban government, with demands ranging from military intervention to lifting the decadeslong embargo. Biden is in a tricky situation. The Cuba sanctions program is already the most comprehensive one administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, giving Biden little room for additional sanctions. Since the protests, Bidens administration has sanctioned three Cuban officials and two entities it says were involved in the crackdown -- the Cuban National Revolutionary Police and an elite brigade of government forces known as the ""Black Berets."" But these sanctions are largely symbolic. Earlier this year, the Biden administration maintained Cuba on the list of countries that arent cooperating fully with U.S. efforts to fight terrorism, surprising many -- including those in Cubas government. Since that moment and especially after the protests, the rhetoric by officials in both countries has intensified, with the United States condemning human rights abuses in Cuba and officials on the island accusing the U.S. government of fomenting the unrest. Even after Cubas embassy in Paris was attacked with gasoline bombs, Cubas government blamed the United States and ""the continuous campaigns against our country."" Jason Poblete, a Washington, D.C., attorney and Republican who has been critical of Bidens response, advocated for stricter measures against Cubas government, including more restrictions on the decadeslong embargo and on sanctions. ""July 11 is perhaps a once-in-a-generation event,"" Poblete said. ""Stakeholders should be reaching across party and ideological lines to develop a new policy."" A man is arrested during a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana on July 11. Yamil Lage / AFP - Getty Images file Last week, Biden met with a group of Cuban American elected officials and community leaders to discuss the U.S. response. Some -- on the left and the right -- criticized the meeting, saying the group didn't encompass how all Cuban Americans feel. Others said the administration should be listening to Cubans on the island rather than those here. Ric Herrero, executive director of the Cuba Study Group, which advocates for more engagement between the two countries, was at the recent White House meeting and highlighted ""practical steps"" the administration can take, especially to enhance internet access, which is something many see as crucial to giving the Cuban population more information as well as more freedom of expression. Herrero said the steps include ""allowing cloud-based subscription services, online payment and peer-to-peer platforms to operate in Cuba that are currently prohibited due to U.S. sanctions,"" as other more complex methods, like high-altitude balloons to expand internet access, are studied. Herrero thinks measures that former President Donald Trump took against Cuba -- like limiting travel, remittances and downsizing the embassy -- are harmful ""because what youre trying to do is help strengthen the people."" At the meeting, there was a diversity of opinion from the right and the left, according to Carmen Pelaez, a filmmaker and activist who was part of the group of around nine Cuban Americans. ""You had every perspective on U.S.-Cuba policy represented,"" Pelaez said, ""but the focus was on how best to support the Cuban people."" In Florida, foreign policy is domestic politics While the protests in Cuba have subsided, in Miami the momentum continues. Cuban Americans have been rallying in support of them in Miami and Washington, D.C. Cars drive around Miami with Cuban flags, while reggaeton and salsa songs calling for freedom in Cuba play on the radio. The emotion that Cuban Americans feel after hearing the word ""freedom"" chanted in the streets of Cuba is still palpable in conversations. For Biden, the stakes are high. Trump won Florida, traditionally a swing state and the largest one in the country, by about 3 percentage points, reversing gains Democrats had made when former President Barack Obama won the Cuban American vote in 2012. A majority of Cuban Americans in 2020 voted for Trump, with the biggest shift in support for Trump coming from other Latino voter groups from countries that have been impacted by socialism or Marxist movements and therefore support a hard-line stance against Cuba. These groups are all keeping a close eye on how Biden responds to Cuba, making this a sort of litmus test for the president. Trumps administration meshed together policy on Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, often taking measures against Cuba for supporting President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela as the country spiraled into economic crisis. At a recent rally in Miamis Bayfront Park, hundreds gathered to call for freedom for Cuba -- and Venezuela and Nicaragua as well. Sol Diaz, 7, attends a rally at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami on Saturday. Matias J. Ocner / AP Following the protests, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican, called for exploring air strikes and military intervention against Cuba. Republicans have capitalized on events in Cuba. Two days after the protests, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis held a roundtable in Miami to address concerns, the GOP held a town hall at the iconic Versailles restaurant near the Little Havana neighborhood that was hosted by Fox News Sean Hannity, and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, of California, launched a Leaders Advisory Team on Cuba and traveled to Miami this week, not only meeting with Cuban Americans, but also Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Colombians, and Peruvians - groups who have grappled with socialist governments or movements in their home countries. Cuban American members of congress have also participated in the ""freedom"" rallies in Miami and Washington, D.C. ""Republicans have turned Cuba pandering into a science,"" said Herrero, adding that the demands being made regarding what to do in Cuba are not practical. ""Republicans know this,"" Herrero said. ""And theyre going to continue to hammer away at demands for a military intervention because what they want to do is embarrass Biden."" But Republicans have been notoriously good at actively engaging Cuban Americans and other Latino diasporas. Trump launched his Cuba policy in 2017 with an audience of Cuban Americans in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, and visits by administration officials never stopped. Some Democrats have asked Biden to come to Miami and address Cuban Americans. Since the protests, Florida Democrats have been forceful in their statements against Cubas government, but collectively, their engagement has not reached the scale of Republicans. Florida Agricultural Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide agency Democrat, who is also running for governor in 2022, has been active, meeting with Cuban American leaders, participating in a Miami protest and repeatedly tweeting about Cuba, calling for freedom. Both the Democratic National Committee and Nuestro PAC have launched ads targeting Cuban American voters by highlighting Biden's support for Cuban people. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also released an ad in Florida and Washington, D.C., promising eternal support for protesters in Cuba.

Cuban doctors voice rare criticism of government's Covid-19 handling,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/22/americas/cuba-doctors-covid-intl/index.html,08/22/21,www.cnn.com,"Havana (CNN) Following widespread anti-government protests last month , the Cuban government is now receiving unprecedented criticism from health care workers who say officials botched the island's response to the pandemic. Symbols of the socialist health care system pioneered by Fidel Castro, doctors and nurses are usually praised as ""heroes in white coats"" by the island's state-run media. In recent years Cuban health care workers have also become a key generator of hard currency for the communist-run government, which sells their services to countries that need doctors. But as Cuba deals with shortages of medicines and oxygen and hospitals are overwhelmed with surging coronavirus cases, tensions between the government and health care workers --who are required to work for the state-- have boiled over. During a visit in August to the hard-hit province of Cienfuegos, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz blamed health care workers' lack of discipline and ""errors"" for the breakdown in medical services. Marrero acknowledged residents had complained about a lack of medicines as well but said ""they are less than the complaints of mistreatment, of neglect or that [doctors] don't make visits. That's incredible!"" The comments ignited a firestorm among health care workers who have borne the brunt of the pandemic in Cuba, often while having to purchase their own protective gear and explain to patients sick with Covid why hospitals have run out of basic medicines and beds. The Cuban government blames the US embargo for breakdowns in the healthcare system, but critics point out that the same US economic sanctions do not prevent the government from investing in a string of shiny new hotels. ""We just ask that they tell the truth,"" said Dr. Rosell Alberteris, in a video posted online. ""We only demand the supplies to treat our patients with dignity and decorum."" ""We want to keep working, we want to keep saving lives,"" said Dr. Daily Almaguer in the video. ""We are not responsible for the sanitary collapse in our country."" At least 39 health care workers have uploaded videos from Holguin, a city of nearly 300,000 people close to the small town where both Fidel and Raul Castro were born, complaining of abysmal conditions in hospitals overrun by Covid. Some of the doctors recorded videos from inside their hospitals, talking barely in a whisper as they slammed their government's failures. More Cuban doctors and nurses on social media from all over the island have expressed their support for the online protest, which is all the more remarkable as the Cuban government on Tuesday announced draconian new measures that prohibited ""fake news"" and postings that damage the island's ""prestige."" ""We aren't afraid of the pandemic, we are afraid of the government,"" Dr. Rafael Alejandro Fuentes Sanchez said in another video posted online. ""How they could interpret that we have come out to demand our rights and the people's right to receive good medical attention."" Cuba's main newspaper, the Communist-party daily Granma said the health workers were being used in ""new enemy campaigns"" and being turned into spokespeople for an ""anti-Cuban offensive."" Cuban officials also looked to defuse the confrontation with their frontline workers as the island's battered health care system confronts the most precarious moment of the pandemic to date. ""Every time it seems we are tired, exhausted, beaten from this long period of the pandemic,"" wrote Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Twitter. ""We think about how much our doctors and nurses have given."" Officials have begun to bring back brigades of Cuban health care workers from postings abroad and admit that the situation is far worse than the island's statistics let on. Amidst a shortage in tests, Cuban Health Minister Jose Angel Portal Miranda told the state-run Invasor newspaper that only people who had a positive Covid result at the time of death are counted as having died of the coronavirus. ""Not all the fatalities are able to take or obtain a PCR result,"" the newspaper concluded. ""Death sometimes arrives first."" Magdiel Jorge Castro told CNN his grandfather died on Wednesday after being sent home from the hospital in Holguin where he was unable to receive results from a Covid test he took days earlier. Oxygen had run out in the hospital. Castro said his grandfather suffered from a fever and fatigue and that other members of his family are ill with Covid-like symptoms. After his grandfather's death, Castro said his family struggled to bury him. ""The funeral services are collapsed. There aren't any coffins,"" Castro said. ""My family was in despair to have a deceased person for 15 hours in their bed in the tropical heat. The funeral home said there were 16 cases like his, people without a place to be buried.""",
"Cuban defector details life under communist regime, warns against US embracing of socialism",https://www.foxnews.com/media/cuban-defector-life-under-communist-regime-socialism,08/25/21,www.foxnews.com,"A Cuban exile is speaking out about the Democrats' dangerous embrace of socialist policies in the United States, pointing to 62 years of dictatorship in his country as evidence of a failed political idealogy. Robert Quintana, who defected from Cuba nearly six decades ago after the Cuban military confiscated his home and all of his family's possessions, joined host Tomi Lahren in a new episode of Fox Nation's ""No Interruption"" to detail the plight of his relatives living under the communist regime. REPUBLICANS SPOTLIGHT CUBA AS SOCIALISM FAILURE AS PROTESTS ERUPT ""We got a knock in 1962 from the Cuban militia...and they confiscated everything we owned,"" Quintana recalled. ""They took everything. We got kicked out, left out on the street. They took the farm, all the livestock that we had. They took my family's entire business and they left us with nothing,"" he said. With Fidel Castro rising to power at the time, it became clear to Quintana and his family that their hometown was no longer safe, he told Lahren. ""They started to show their true colors with their communist mindset and total government control,"" he said. Quintana and his family immigrated to the U.S. shortly thereafter, settling in Miami with nothing but hopes for freedom and a better life. Slowly, they began to settle into the community as other Cubans fleeing Castro joined them in the States. As for his relatives still living under the communist regime, Quintana said he's had a difficult time communicating with them recently because the government ""censors everything that's going on,"" especially in the aftermath of the islands historic uprising that transpired over the last several weeks. ""They monitor everything. They have the power to turn the internet on and off at the flick of a switch. They have been manipulating the access, who can get on, how strong the signal is, when it can be activated,"" he explained. ""The freedom that we have here to speak our minds is not allowed there. You get beaten up,"" he added. Discussing the new episode in an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday, Lahren said, ""These people are resilient people. Cuban Americans as well as those that defected from Cuba, they have wonderful stories that need to be told but really what I heard from them is them sounding the alarm and raising the red flag about what happens when you embrace socialism and communism."" DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS IGNORE CUBAN PROTESTERS RAILING AGAINST COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP ""It always sounds great at the beginning and always sounds like the promise of community and free things,"" Lahren said, ""but it quickly descends into what youre seeing in Cuba for the last 60 plus years.""

Cuba to deploy China's Sinopharm alongside homegrown vaccines,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-deploy-chinas-sinopharm-alongside-homegrown-vaccines-2021-08-28/,08/28/21,www.reuters.com,"Signage of Sinopharm is seen at the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), following the COVID-19 outbreak, in Beijing, China September 5, 2020. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang HAVANA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Cuba, which to date had deployed exclusively its homegrown COVID-19 vaccines, will start also using the Sinopharm vaccine of its Communist-run ally China in its bid to battle one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world. Health authorities will apply two doses of Sinopharm combined with a Cuban booster in the central province of Cienfuegos from Sunday, Vicente Verez, the head of the Cuban Finlay Vaccine Institute, was cited as saying by the provincial state-run outlet 5deSeptiembre. The efficacy of the vaccine combo is above 90%, according to the outlet, without detailing where the data came from or whether Cuba's drug regulator had authorized the use of the Chinese vaccine. The World Health Organization gave emergency approval to the Sinopharm shot in May. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Authorities who had said earlier this month they would be able to produce enough vaccines for all of Cuba by September did not explain why they were choosing to deploy a foreign one now. ""It seems obvious the decision to apply Sinopharm in Cienfuegos is associated to the limited availability of Cuban vaccines and the urgency caused by the explosion of cases,"" said Brazil-based Cuban virologist Amilcar Perez Riverol. The health ministry had said in May the plan was to have vaccinated 70% of the population by August but had so far only reached around 30%, said Perez Riverol, who has become a guru on Cuban COVID-19 data analysis, on Facebook. Meanwhile, Cuba has one of the highest COVID-19 caseloads in the world which is overwhelming its vaunted healthcare system which is heavily focused on prevention and primary care. The outbreak comes amid a shortage of basic goods including medicine that has fueled anger at the government, leading to unprecedented nationwide protests last month. Cuban authorities, which blame the economic crisis largely on a tightening of U.S. sanctions, have hailed donations of medical gear and food since the protests from allies like China although it was unclear if the vaccines were donated or bought. TOO LATE? Government critics had long urged it to acquire foreign vaccines rather than simply relying on homegrown ones, accusing it of placing its desire for prestige and good publicity over health concerns. Authorities said they preferred to focus scant resources on vaccine development and production than imports. U.S. President Joe Biden said last month the United States was prepared to send vaccines to Cuba if it was assured an international organization would administer them. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel retorted that if the United States cared about the island's humanitarian situation, it would lift the U.S. sanctions they accuse amongst other things of slowing down production of its homegrown vaccines. The country has developed an unusually large biotech sector for a country its size, partly in a bid for sovereignty given the decades-old crippling U.S. trade embargo. It is the only Latin American country to have completed the development of two COVID-19 vaccines, Soberana 2 and Abdala, which have elicited interest from nations worldwide from Jamaica and Mexico to Vietnam and Argentina. It says the three shot vaccines both have efficacy of over 90% although the data has not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. It has authorized both for emergency use.

Cuba struggles to keep the lights on given decrepit grid,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-struggles-keep-lights-given-decrepit-grid-2021-09-17/,09/17/21,www.reuters.com,"A woman walks past houses in quarantine amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Havana, Cuba, April 8, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini HAVANA, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Cuban state media said on Friday that the intermittent blackouts that have plagued the island since June are caused by an aging power infrastructure and lack of proper maintenance and cautioned that residents should be prepared for more in the coming months. The power outages reflect a deepening economic crisis that began with harsh new U.S. sanctions in 2019 and worsened with the pandemic, exposing such vulnerabilities as a decaying infrastructure and dependence on foreign currency from tourism and remittances to purchase food, medicine, raw materials and spare parts. ""No one should think the problem will be solved quickly,"" Energy and Mining Minister Livan Arronte Cruz was quoted as stating during a discussion of the power grid with other officials broadcast by state-run television on Thursday evening. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register The participants said Cuban power plants averaged 35 years of age, with a backup system of hundreds of smaller generators at least 15 years old and that just 5% of power came from alternative energy sources. The blackouts bring back memories of the post-Soviet depression of the 1990s, when lights were off more than they were on due to fuel shortages. Nowadays, the outages are not a daily occurrence, rarely last longer than four hours and are due to infrastructure failure. The minister and other energy officials have appeared frequently to explain the power situation since a day of protests over living conditions swept the country on July 11, sparked in part by blackouts. The government explanations offered on Thursday included how and why power outages were carried out, details on specific neighborhoods and how citizens can help by doing little things like turning off a single light or opening their refrigerators less often. Cuba's economy declined 10.9% last year and 2% through June this year compared with the same period in 2020, after years of stagnation. Cubans have withstood more than 18 months of pandemic lockdowns, food and medicine shortages, long lines to purchase scarce goods, high prices and more. With tourism hurting and other vital sources of jobs and funds closed down, the blackouts have only added to the pain and frustration. Edier Guzman Pacheco, director of power plants on the Communist-run Caribbean island, was quoted as stating during Thursday's broadcast that the crisis meant funds were scarce for maintenance and that work on two new generators was delayed after suppliers canceled contracts due to new Trump-era U.S. sanctions. This, he said, was leading to lower than capacity output and frequent breakdowns. ""Of the 20 thermo generators in the country, 18 are overdue for light or partial maintenance and 16 capital maintenance,"" he said. Minister Arronte Cruz made no promises as the broadcast concluded except that residents would be kept informed. He said the country was doing everything it could under the circumstances to avoid blackouts and that there were plans in the medium to long term to increase capacity and alternative energy sources. ""No one should think we are doing this intentionally to annoy the people,"" he said.

El Enjambre provided detailed coverage of the remarkable July 11 anti-government protests in Cuba and searing criticism of the ruthless crackdown that followed. The hosts also dissected the dismal state of the health care system as Covid-19 cases surged on the island, mocked the sputtering initiatives by the government to allow some private sector activities, such as garage sales, and attempted to read the tea leaves on the future of Washingtons relationship with Havana. Each episode includes a short, humorous, scripted drama, a segment called History without Hysteria and a lengthy conversation that tends to focus on the issues Cubans have been arguing about on social media over the past few days. ""The objective was to create a conversation like youd have on any street corner in Cuba,"" Mr. Condis said. ""But we provide only verified facts, because it matters greatly to us to never provide false information."" Mr. Condis said he steered clear of using what he views as needlessly polarizing language, refraining, for instance, from referring to the Cuban government as a dictatorship. The hosts dont take for granted the relative freedom they have enjoyed so far in criticizing the government. After all, Cuba does not have press freedom laws and critical journalists are often subject to harassment and home detention. ""At any moment they might go to war with us and take us off the air,"" Mr. Condis said. If anyone has been pushing the boundaries its Ms. Sanchez, an ardent critic of the government who first gained prominence as an early adopter of technology in 2007, when she began writing a raw and lyrical blog about life on the island. In December 2018, when Cubas telecommunications company Etecsa began offering data plans for smartphones, Ms. Sanchez saw an opportunity to expand the reach of her journalism, which had previously been distributed as an emailed newsletter and a PDF file.",

Hes on a hunger strike demanding the United Nations grant him a meeting, so he can address the issue of human rights in Cuba. ""Physically, Im exhausted, really exhausted,"" Rocha said. The only thing hes consumed since the strike began is water and Pedialyte. Rochas demonstration began in Sarasota, Florida, where hes been based for the last six years. A week into his hunger strike, he boarded a plane to New York City where he camped out in front of the U.N. Secretariat Building. Rocha is a native Spaniard, but he has family in Cuba and feels inextricably linked to what has taken place there. In July, thousands took to the streets across Cuba in protests not seen since Fidel Castro took power during the 1959 revolution. Marchers and demonstrators protested the shortages of food, medicine and fuel, and there were chants for ""Libertad!"" (freedom). Rocha denounced the government for the protest-related detentions and because people have gone ""missing,"" he said. The human rights group Cubalex recorded approximately 800 detentions as demonstrators were arrested for speaking out. As of September, Cubalex said there have been 1,067 complaints of detentions, with around half of them still allegedly detained, including over a dozen minors. The Cuban government confirmed in July it had started trials for those detained for charges including assault, instigating unrest, committing vandalism and propagating the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. and European and Latin American countries have denounced the lack of human rights and democracy on the island. Rocha said all he wants is a meeting with a U.N. official. He said he has reached out to the U.N. on several occasions via email, requesting the meeting and outlining his demands, and has not received a response. ""It doesnt have to be with [United Nations Secretary-General] Antonio Guterres; it doesnt have to be with [United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] Michelle Bachelet. I just want to meet with an official,"" Rocha said. ""I have no thoughts about ending the hunger strike until they meet."" Rochas demands include the U.N. publicly creating a resolution denouncing the humanitarian crisis in Cuba, the expulsion of Cuba from the United Nations Human Rights Council and providing proof of life and subsequent release of all political prisoners in Cuba. NBC News Now reached out to the U.N. for comment and did not receive a response. Rocha was hoping to remain stationed outside the U.N. headquarters for General Assembly week, but he was escorted out of the area by New York police on Saturday as the city prepared to receive hundreds of political leaders from around the globe. Rocha is continuing his strike in Central Park, next to a statue of Cuban revolutionary Jose Marti. Fellow activists stay by him day and night to make sure his health doesnt deteriorate. Rocha said theyre not his friends but his ""angels."" ""They dont leave my side 24 hours a day,"" he said. When Rocha sleeps, they take turns guarding his tent.

Cuba's foreign minister says it's a mistake for Biden to keep Trump sanctions on Havana,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latin-america/cuba-s-foreign-minister-says-it-s-mistake-biden-keep-n1280433,09/30/21,www.nbcnews.com,"The Cuban government is disappointed President Joe Biden has kept in place economic sanctions on Havana imposed by his predecessor, but the government remains ready to reopen a dialogue with the United States, Cuba's foreign minister said in an interview. Speaking to NBC News' Andrea Mitchell in New York, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said it was a mistake to continue enforcing sanctions introduced by former President Donald Trump's administration, particularly amid a pandemic. ""Maybe there is an inertia effect. It's a pity that President Biden couldn't implement his own policy toward Cuba,"" Rodriguez said. ""It's a terrible mistake to continue implementing this kind of cruel sanctions, even sanctions during a pandemic."" Watch ""Andrea Mitchell Reports"" today at noon ET on MSNBC for more on this story. He accused the Biden administration of neglecting the Caribbean and Latin American region but said he was hopeful the U.S. might revisit its policies toward Cuba. ""I hope that, because of the nature of this government, it could be possible to expect a positive step."" Rodriguez said the policies of former President Barack Obama, who in a break with past presidents eased restrictions on travel and trade with Cuba, proved it was possible to have a less contentious relationship. ""The years 2015, 2016 show that it's possible to have a different kind of relationship between both our countries, despite profound political differences between the governments,"" he said. ""And we are ready for establishing ... some responsible dialogue with the U.S. administration."" The Trump administration reversed Obama's detente with Cuba, imposing over 200 trade, travel and financial restrictions while returning Cuba to the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Removing the terrorism designation is a time-consuming process that requires congressional approval. The Trump administration also slashed staffing at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, effectively shutting down consular services. It justified the move by citing unexplained health incidents that affected personnel at the mission. Similar health incidents have since been reported at other embassies around the world. Rodriguez said his government would welcome the return of U.S. diplomats to Havana and would like to see Washington grant permission for the Cuban Embassy to return to full staffing. The foreign minister played down unprecedented protests in July that saw Cubans take to the streets across the country to air grievances over food shortages, power outages and the regime's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Rodriguez alleged that many of those protesting had been manipulated by Florida-based groups that were spreading ""misinformation"" online to foment opposition to the regime. But he acknowledged ""economic conditions are very difficult for Cubans"" and that people had ""anxiety"" about the situation. He said the effects of Covid and U.S. sanctions were mainly to blame for the country's economic troubles. Human rights groups say hundreds of Cubans were jailed for taking part in peaceful protests, and that the regime disrupted internet access and ramped up its repression of critics since the July demonstrations.",

The Communist-run country was rocked by social unrest for two days in July, with the biggest anti-government protests in decades resulting in hundreds of arrests, one death and calls for U.S. intervention by some Cuban-Americans. A brief armed forces communique published in state-run media said the defense exercises, canceled last year, would resume in tandem with other activities as a vaccination campaign nears its goal of immunizing the entire population against COVID-19.

Well-known government opponents are among those who remain behind bars following the July 11-12 unrest, some facing long sentences. Archipelago members say the group has some 20,000 members, many of whom live outside the country. The government's defense preparations are part of a military doctrine known as the ""War of the Whole People"" designed to respond to a U.S. invasion. The last day features thousands of civilians evacuating work centers, tending to the wounded, engaged in weapons training and logistical support such as making bullets and cooking. Civilians have also been used in the past to bolster the government in times of public dissent, with protesters harassed by members of local block committees known as Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, for example, or official trade unions. 'THREAT OF ARMS' ""They intend to further militarize the country for 20N, (Nov. 20)"" tweeted playwright Yunior Garcia, administrator of Archipelago and leader of the planned protests. Unlike the July unrest, which was largely spontaneous, the group has requested permission for marches in various cities on Nov. 20, to which the government has yet to respond. ""Faced with the civility of our march, they respond with the threat of arms. Why so afraid that people will speak their minds? Weapons, no! Rights,"" Garcia said. Authorities in Cuba have long termed dissenters small groups in the pay of the United States. They charge their opponents are working with Washington to whip up unrest during the pandemic and to impose ever harsher economic sanctions in hopes of overthrowing the government.

Archipelago said it recently asked Cubas federal government permission to stage what it described as ""a peaceful march for civil liberties in the capital Havana and a few other provinces."" Cuban state authorities rejected the groups proposal this week, however, according to a letter Archipelago said it received from government officials. ""The protesters... as well as their links with some subversive organizations... have the open intention of changing the political system in Cuba,"" the letter read, according to Reuters. ""The protests are a provocation and part of a regime change strategy for Cuba tested in other countries,"" the letter continued. Cubas communist government has always prohibited citizens from protesting, with few exceptions. Reforms to Cubas constitution approved in 2019 seemed to have opened an opportunity for public assembly on the island. ""Article 61 states that these rights 'For lawful and peaceful purposes, are recognized by the State whenever they are exercised with respect to public order and compliance with the mandatory provisions of the law,'"" Amnesty International reported of the constitutional changes when they were first passed in 2018. The human rights organization noted at the time, however, that Cubas government ""continues to place undue restrictions on freedom of assembly, demonstration and association."" ""In practice, protest by political opposition groups and human rights defenders are not tolerated by the authorities,"" the organization observed. ""Since Cubas 1959 revolution, authorities have tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by the United States, which has long openly sought to force political change through sanctions and democracy initiatives,"" Reuters recalled on August 12. Despite ongoing restrictions on public assembly, Cuba recently experienced an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests nationwide in July. Thousands of Cubans poured onto the countrys streets from July 11-12 to protest the islands worsening economic crisis and lack of civil liberties. Cuban police arrested roughly 800 people for participating in Julys banned demonstrations. Hundreds of these detained protesters remained in jail as of early August, according to Cubalex, a human rights organization. ""While 249 people have been released, many to house arrest, most remain in 'preventative jail,'"" Cubalex director Laritza Diversent told Reuters on August 12, adding, ""The whereabouts of 10 people is unknown.""",
'Imperialist News Agencies Incite Social Uprising' in Cuba,https://havanatimes.org/features/imperialist-news-agencies-incite-social-uprising-in-cuba/,10/15/21,havanatimes.org,"The Cuban government intends to prevent November 15th from becoming the new July 11th. (14ymedio) By 14ymedio HAVANA TIMES -Three European media outlets have been added to the list of imperialist press headed by CNN, according to the Cuban government. The British BBC, the Spanish agency EFE, and the French France Presse ""do not tire of inciting from within their pages a social uprising that would justify the much-desired military intervention from the White House,"" signaled the official newspaper Granma this Thursday. The state-run press, which now intends to deactivate 15N (15 November) by broadcasting the message that it does not have support from within the Island, accused these international media outlets, which also include the Miami-based daily, El Nuevo Herald, of ""legitimizing the provocative actions of internal mercenary 'pacifists, blind with hate and vengeance"". In addition, Granma classifies these agencies and television chains as ""mainstream"", unlike in Cuba where all legal print, radio and TV media is controlled by the State. In the same, rather long article titled, ""The counterrevolutionaries will not have a platform in Cuba,"" the Communist Party daily uses various testimonies of farm workers who oppose the marches and praise the Revolution and Fidel Castro. ""We will not allow them a new July 11th,"" begins the text. The phrase is attributed to a farmer from Playa, in Havana, although it sums up the authorities decision to impede the civic marches organized by the Archipelago collective for the 15th of November, moved forward as the initial date -November 20th-coincided with a suddenly created National Defense Day. Several messages shared on social media maintain that the Government intends to mobilize Cuban citizens against the marches through two means: virtual and physical. Archipelago published several screen shots that presumably show messages from university group chats attempting to organize an online strategy to support other efforts. On Whatsapp, users carefully study the words of artist Yunior Garcia, one of the organizers of the marches, and also an organizer of Archipelago itself, to ""deconstruct his speech."" The objective, according to one message, ""is not to prevent the march but to prevent more people from joining"". Another screen grab circulating among organizers contains messages from a young high school student who confirms that in his school they have been obligated -though he adds that he and one other student refused-, to join ""rapid response groups"" which will carry sticks ""to defend themselves"". In the exchange, the student maintains that they were told that on the 15th, they should also wear an armband. Though the source of both messages is unknown, at Archipelago they do not doubt their veracity and though they fear the regimes response, they will maintain their position to the end. ""On November 15th our personal decision will be to march civically and peacefully for our rights. Facing authoritarianism, we will respond with civility and more civility"", they said on Wednesday. The governments idea is to demotivate those who are questioning whether they will join the march, at least, that is what is all over the Granma article. With other testimonies they intend to add the support of laborers and farmers, united for the Revolution. ""The primary mission of farmers, to wave our flag and our accomplishments very high, is to continue producing food. That should be how we resolve our problems today,"" signaled one of the producers of the Havana-based cooperative. Its president joins the discussion. ""With the victory of 59 our sector gained rights, prestige, and morale. Now it is our duty to support the Revolution, producing, offering nourishment to the people."" The sector is held as an example by Granma that true patriots are those who work to feed Cubans, thus they highlight that this cooperative has surpassed its production target this year, achieving 123% of the planned production. ""The majority of us are in favor of the revolution. I am convinced that our young people have the same opinion. Twenty or thirty young people who work with me share my ideals because were all trained under the wings of our socialist society, with its defects, but essential,"" says the successful large-scale milk producing cooperative. Nonetheless, milk is scarce and in Havana, for example, theyve had to restrict access to milk and dairy products. The Communist Partys daily paper also approached the National Center for the Production of Laboratory Animals, where it supposedly encountered many others opposed to the demonstrations on 15N from employees to whom ""the much-demanded march seems shameful, nothing more than another strategy with no benefit for the people."" ""They tried to defeat us in Giron (Bay of Pigs 1961) and they continue trying to this day, with the economic blockade and all their measures, but they have not been able to handle us. They choose to ignore our years of history, as a result, they dont learn that Cuba will never surrender,"" says the chief of the companys Technology Surveillance Department. Granma has also found a young woman, 24, who, in contrast to many of her generation who have chosen to leave the Island, chose to praise the State model imposed for more than six decades. ""As militants, as workers who have seen the revolutionary actions and vocation which the Cuban people have maintained for more than 60 years, we will always follow the ideals of Fidel."" According to the text, all these voices ""are not a manipulated minority"", but just in case, the government wont allow any polling to test which side the majority supports.

"Human Rights Watch says Cuba arbitrarily abused, arrested protesters in July",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/human-rights-watch-says-cuba-arbitrarily-abused-arrested-protesters-july-2021-10-19/,10/19/21,www.reuters.com,"People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo MIAMI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday that Cuba's government had arbitrarily arrested, beaten and abused protesters following unprecedented demonstrations earlier this year in a bid to strike fear into the populace and clamp down on dissent. Thousands of Cubans marched on July 11 in the largest protests to rock the communist-run country since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. Security forces shut down the rallies amid a flurry of arrests and one death. The streets of the island nation have since been largely quiet. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had documented at least 130 cases in which security forces violated due process, beat, sexually abused or forced into solitary confinement citizens participating in rallies it described as ""overwhelmingly peaceful anti-government protests."" Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register Cuba has denied reports of systematic abuses or torture. The government has blamed the protests on meddling by the United States, which has for decades openly sought to force reform on its island neighbor through sanctions and financing for democracy programs. Human Rights Watch said it had nonetheless gathered evidence of rights abuses by Cuban police and military from phone interviews with activists, victims, their relatives, journalists, and lawyers, as well as from case files, press reports and photos and video. ""When thousands of Cubans took to the streets in July, the Cuban government responded with a brutal strategy of repression designed to instill fear and suppress dissent,"" said HRW researcher Juan Pappier. Over 1,000 people were arrested, according to the Cuban rights group Cubalex, and at least 500 are still detained or under house arrest. Cubans have suffered food, fuel and medicine shortages for the last few years, as well as widespread power blackouts since June, issues made acute by the two-year pandemic that shuttered the global tourism industry critical to keeping Cuba's economy afloat. ""They took to the streets because they had nothing to lose,"" Human Rights Watch director Jose Miguel Vivanco told reporters in Miami. ""Well, the government showed them first-hand that they had a lot to lose."" The abuse allegations come just weeks ahead of another dissident march slated for Nov. 15, the first major call to protest since July 11. Cuba has already declared the march - set for the same day the Caribbean island nation plans to reopen to international tourism - illegal, setting up an ill-timed showdown with protesters. HRW director Vivanco said it was likely the government would be much better prepared this time around. ""We shall see if, for the 15th of November, Cubans ... will be allowed to exercise their universally protected right to peaceful protest, or if they will be stifled by fear.""

Cuba calls for 'National Defense Day' on the same day of human rights protests,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-calls-national-defense-day-day-human-rights-protests-rcna2772,10/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"HAVANA -- Cuba announced Friday it would conduct annual military exercises on Nov. 18-19, leading up to a day of civilian defense preparedness on Nov. 20, the same date dissidents plan human rights protests around the country. The Communist-run country was rocked by social unrest for two days in July, with the biggest anti-government protests in decades resulting in hundreds of arrests, one death and calls for U.S. intervention by some Cuban-Americans. A brief armed forces communique published in state-run media said the defense exercises, canceled last year, would resume in tandem with other activities as a vaccination campaign nears its goal of immunizing the entire population against COVID-19. The aim of the Nov. 20 demonstrations, called by a Facebook group named Archipelago, is to call for civil liberties including the right to peaceful protest and an amnesty for imprisoned government opponents. Well-known government opponents are among those who remain behind bars following the July 11-12 unrest, some facing long sentences. Archipelago members say the group has some 20,000 members, many of whom live outside the country. The governments defense preparations are part of a military doctrine known as the ""War of the Whole People"" designed to respond to a U.S. invasion. The last day features thousands of civilians evacuating work centers, tending to the wounded, engaged in weapons training and logistical support such as making bullets and cooking. Civilians have also been used in the past to bolster the government in times of public dissent, with protesters harassed by members of local block committees known as Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, for example, or official trade unions. 'THREAT OF ARMS ""They intend to further militarize the country for 20N, (Nov. 20)"" tweeted playwright Yunior Garcia, administrator of Archipelago and leader of the planned protests. Unlike the July unrest, which was largely spontaneous, the group has requested permission for marches in various cities on Nov. 20, to which the government has yet to respond. ""Faced with the civility of our march, they respond with the threat of arms. Why so afraid that people will speak their minds? Weapons, no! Rights,"" Garcia said. Authorities in Cuba have long termed dissenters small groups in the pay of the United States. They charge their opponents are working with Washington to whip up unrest during the pandemic and to impose ever harsher economic sanctions in hopes of overthrowing the government. Residents have faced food, medicine and other shortages amid coronavirus lockdowns and a severe blow to the tourism industry, and have had to endure long lines, high prices and power blackouts for the last few years.

Cuba lawmakers approve greater rights for protesters accused of crimes,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-lawmakers-approve-greater-rights-protesters-accused-crimes-rcna4108,10/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"HAVANA -- Cubas National Assembly on Thursday approved a raft of laws broadening citizens legal rights even as the Communist-run country comes under fire at home and abroad for a crackdown on protests earlier this year. The changes stem from the 2019 constitution, which required reforms to modernize Cubas judicial and penal codes. But they address legal voids identified by activists, who allege authorities flaunted due process following unprecedented protests on the island in July. Cuban lawmakers and judges said the new laws increase protection for those accused of a crime and should improve transparency. They require, for example, defendants be notified of potential charges against them, and that those detained be granted the right to an attorney within 24 hours. Citizens will also be allowed access to their own court files and documents, according to the new law. Eloy Viera, a Cuban lawyer and legal analyst who lives in Canada, said the laws were a major step forward in enshrining a citizens right to defend him or herself in a court of law. ""This law offers more guarantees and adheres much more to international standards than the regulations currently in force,"" Viera said. But how those laws are implemented will determine whether or not Cubans see significant changes in their legal rights, said William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University in Washington. ""The laws... still give officials considerable discretion and only time will tell how they use it, especially in political cases,"" he said. Dissidents and human rights organizations say more than 1,000 demonstrators were arrested after the July protests, the largest anti-government rallies since Fidel Castros 1959 revolution. Some prisoners were held without charge, incommunicado and without representation, rights groups say. The Cuban government says those arrested in July were guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest and vandalism. It has declared opposition marches planned for Nov. 15 as illegal, saying they are funded and promoted by the United States. The laws passed Thursday are set to take effect in 2022. Legal analyst Viera said it was unlikely they would be retroactive. ""I do not believe that this new legislation will have a definitive influence on the processes already initiated today, and politically motivated, by the July 11 protesters,"" he said. Some legal experts said any advances in the penal code would be overshadowed by the one-party system of government. ""Supreme court justices can still be dismissed easily. No court may declare unconstitutional a National Assembly act,"" said retired Cuban-American scholar Jorge Dominguez. ""There is no independent entity to protect constitutional rights."" The reforms nonetheless eliminate a long-critiqued law that allowed authorities to jail someone they said was potentially dangerous, a maneuver critics say was often used against dissidents. They also include a prohibition on unlawful detention. Independent journalist Yoani Sanchez said that was not enough. ""Repressive laws are still in force that are arbitrarily applied frequently against opponents, activists and independent journalists, such as home confinement and the prohibition of leaving the country,"" she wrote.

"As activists plan nationwide protests, Cuba accuses U.S. of involvement",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-government-heats-rhetoric-us-ahead-protests-planned-november-15-rcna3809,10/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"As activists in Cuba defy the government and continue preparing for nationwide protests Nov. 15, the government is ratcheting up its rhetoric against the U.S., accusing it of financing and directing protesters. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a speech Sunday that the protests were ""a plan orchestrated by the exterior."" In the province of Matanzas, east of the capital, Havana, authorities on Sunday observed ""el dia territorial de la defensa"" -- loosely translated as a territorial defense day -- to prepare for a possible invasion from what the government called ""the enemy."" A video on a Cuban news broadcast showed defense officials meeting with local workers about preparedness, armed people practicing a response to an attack and schools holding drills. In his speech, Diaz-Canel said earlier protests on July 11 were ""nothing more than provocations and acts of vandalism as part of the strategy of the nonconventional war and the 'soft coup against our revolution."" He said the march being organized for less than three weeks from now involves think tanks and U.S. government spokespeople. The planned marchs most vocal leader, Yunior Garcia, denied the claims and said organizers had made a pact not to take outside funding. The U.S. has expressed support for the protesters after the events in July. After the Cuban governments crackdown, the U.S. sanctioned several government officials and entities in August. Diaz-Canel said the U.S. Embassy in Havana is ""subverting the internal order of our country."" He said U.S. diplomats frequently meet with ""those who head the counterrevolution,"" saying they offer orientation, logistical support and financing. A State Department spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that ""the U.S. government supports the right of Cubans and people everywhere to exercise their freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly,"" adding, ""We call on the Cuban government to respect these rights and see this not as an attack, but as an opportunity to listen to the Cuban people and do what is right for Cubans and for Cuba."" The Cuban Embassy in the U.S. has not responded to a request for comment. In his speech, Diaz-Canel said, ""The declared objective of the United States government is to topple the Cuban revolution."" He said that the Biden administrations policy toward Cuba is ""trapped by its desire to win the Florida vote,"" which he said is dominated by ""the Cuban American mafia in Miami,"" remarks similar to those he and other officials have made in the past. The tone is similar to the one Cuba struck after the historic protests on July 11, when thousands of people took to the streets to air grievances, from the lack of political change to the chronic shortages on the island. While Diaz-Canel said in July that the government had to make ""a critical analysis of our own problems ... so we can transform situations,"" he blamed the U.S. and the effects of the decadeslong embargo for the protests. Government officials have begun to vilify the young activists planning the Nov. 15 protests on state-run television, accusing them of being directed by the U.S. The government rejected the activists official request to protest, saying it was an effort to overthrow the government. The day of the march coincides with the day Cuba opens its borders to tourism. Lillian Guerra, a professor of Cuban and Caribbean history at the University of Florida, said ""fearmongering"" about a U.S. invasion was one of the pillars of the Cuban governments discourse before the 2000s. ""What that entails is not just fear of a U.S. invasion,"" Guerra said. ""It was fear that exiles, people who had 'made it in the United States, were going to come back and take over their country."" But ""that argument doesnt work anymore,"" and it doesn't reflect what many in Cuba see on the ground as more Cuban Americans have invested in the island through family ties, improving economic conditions for their relatives, she said. For Cubans in the island advocating for changes from the government, preparing for a U.S. invasion seems out of touch with their reality. The Cuban governments strategy of blaming the U.S. to ""neutralize the discussions"" about the protests and pushing a theory that there is ""no discontent on the island"" doesnt take into account the reality on the ground, Guerra said. ""What is arising is oppositional culture,"" she said. ""Its not a rising opposition. Its a rising oppositional culture."" Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
'We know terrible things can happen:' Cuba opposition leader vows national march,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/-know-terrible-things-can-happen-cuba-opposition-leader-vows-national-rcna3604,10/21/21,www.nbcnews.com,"In defiance of Cuba's government, a young artist who has emerged as one of the country's leading opposition leaders vowed that he and others are moving forward with national protests planned for Nov. 15. ""We know we can go to prison, we know terrible things can happen,"" Yunior Garcia, 39, told NBC News via WhatsApp messages about the planned demonstration to demand civil liberties in the communist country. ""We are already living them."" On July 11, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in historic protests calling for change and demanding an end to food and medicine shortages. Following the protests, the Cuban government detained and imprisoned hundreds of people. A recent Human Rights Watch report found security forces violated due process, beat, sexually abused or forced into solitary confinement Cubans who participated in the protests. The Cuban government has denied reports of abuse. Over 560 people are still jailed, including some of the most well-known activists, according to the human rights group Cubalex. On Thursday, prosecutors summoned opposition leaders and warned them against protesting. Garcia, 39, is undeterred. ""Nov. 15 has to happen because we havent been allowed to protest for 62 years,"" he said, adding that if one counts the years before Fidel Castro under dictator Fulgencio Batista, its been 70 years without democracy. Garcia said that authorities had cut off his cellphone and that he was using one that had been loaned to him. He quoted Castro: ""Within the revolution, everything. Against the revolution, nothing."" ""It's difficult to define what is revolution at this moment,"" Garcia said. Thursday wasnt the first time the government had rejected the planned protests. They were first scheduled for Nov. 20 but authorities declared that a ""National Defense Day"" when citizens practice for an invasion by the United States. Organizers decided to change the day of the protest to Nov. 15, but the government denied the request, saying it's an effort to overthrow the government. After the protests this summer, Garcia launched a Facebook group for political debate called Archipelago, where members have called for the protests, scheduled to take place in the capital, Havana, and six other provinces. The government has taken to state-run media to make its case. Last week, Garcia was vilified on television, where they said he is backed by the United States, who Cuba accuses of trying to destabilize the country. Cuba generally characterizes most opposition leaders as ""mercenaries."" They called the protest a ""provocation."" When Garcia picked up the official governments response to the protest request, a small group of people held signs with dollar bills on them, insinuating he is financially backed by the United States government. ""We have the power to change it"" Garcia denies all such claims and said members of Archipelago made a pact to not receive any type of funding. He said at one point he thought it was possible to hold a dialogue with the government, ""but when you see all the lies, the defamation, blackmail, threats from authorities then you lose hope for a dialogue."" ""They have reached out to our families with blackmail, with defamations, and trying to pit our parents against us. Many of us have been surprised at the dignity of the parents, who until yesterday, believed in the revolution,"" Garcia said. ""But seeing the blackmail has disappointed them and they have quickly realized they have been living a lie."" The pandemic along with a decadeslong U.S. embargo and the state-run, communist economy has left the government, the sole importer of goods, with little hard currency to purchase food, medicine and hygiene products, leading to widespread shortages. Many young Cubans are disenchanted with the way Cuba is run and the lack of change during the past 60 years. Not seeing a future for themselves on the island, the solution for many Cubans has historically been to emigrate, but that has become more difficult in recent years. ""I think that has changed and people believe they need to be here. This is the country we were born in and we have the power to change it,"" Garcia said. He believes change can be achieved in Cuba through ""democratic and peaceful means."" Since 1959, protests against the government have been forbidden, but the new constitution approved in 2019 opened a space for demonstrations deemed ""legitimate."" Garcia says he is against the U.S. embargo on Cuba and any foreign military intervention. But he also stated that ""if there is such a brutal embargo against medicines and food then how is it possible that for tourists, all these resources magically appear?"" ""If this is really a socialist country, how is it possible we live so differently?"" Garcia said. ""There is enormous inequality, just like there is in the worst capitalism."" Garcia said he would like more freedom to do his work. ""There is one institution [government-run] that you belong to, and outside that institution its very difficult to perform your art."" On Friday, Garcia tweeted that he woke up to find a dead chicken hanging on the door of his house with blood and dirt on the floor. Though it's an act used in the Afro-Cuban Santeria religion meant to inflict harm on a person, Garcia said he didn't see it as a religious act, but more one of political repudiation. Cuba plans to open its borders to tourism on Nov. 15 -- the day of the planned protest. As to whether fear of a crackdown will deter large numbers of Cubans from marching in November, Garcia said, ""People are becoming empowered -- they are losing their fear."" ""We cannot continue living like sheep,"" he said. ""This is the country where my grandparents were born, and we cannot allow a group to kidnap an entire country and have us muzzled.""

Cuba: Disobeying Protest Ban to have Serious Consequences,https://havanatimes.org/news/cuba-disobeying-protest-ban-to-have-serious-consequences/,10/21/21,havanatimes.org,"The Cuban Attorney Generals Office issues its threat The Cuban Attorney Generals Office. Photo: cubadebate.cu HAVANA TIMES - Today, October 21, the Cuban Attorney Generals Office issued a warning to the people of Havana, Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Holguin and other provinces of the serious consequences of demonstrating peacefully on November 15, or any day. According to the Prosecutors Office, there are some people who insist on promoting ""illegal marches"" even though they are totally prohibited on the island. Apparently, the announcement of the Archipelago group for peaceful marches, even requesting police protection, has the Communist Party and the Cuban Government very concerned. After first rejecting the request, now they promise a strong and violent response through ""legal"" means. Those who decide to participate by marching peacefully could face years in prison for such a serious offense of disobeying power. The same is happening with hundreds of people of the thousands who demonstrated against government policies on July 11th. Next, we publish in full the Attorney Generals warning to possible protesters: Informative Note from the Attorney Generals Office of Cuba ""On October 12, in the legitimate exercise of its functions and with precise legal arguments, government authorities denied the request presented by some citizens to carry out marches in eight provinces of the country, declaring them illegal. ""Taking into account the intention publicly expressed by the petitioners to maintain the call, the Attorney Generals Office, this Thursday, October 21, began the warning to several citizens who, if they did not comply with the decision of the aforementioned authorities, would incur in the crimes of disobedience, illicit protests, instigation to commit a crime, or other possible violations sanctioned in the current criminal legislation. ""The action of the Attorney Generals Office when warning said citizens about the legal consequences of carrying out the march, is based on article 156 of the Constitution, which attributes to this body the mission, among others, of ensuring citizens strict compliance with the Constitution, laws and other legal provisions.

Report: Cuba Engaged in 'Brutal Abuses' Against July Protesters,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/10/21/human-rights-watch-cuba-engaging-in-brutal-abuses-against-july-protesters/,10/21/21,www.breitbart.com,"Cuban officials are committing ""brutal abuses"" against Cubans who participated in the largely peaceful July 11 protests against the countrys 62-year-old communist regime, according to a report released by Human Rights Watch on Tuesday. The report comes as several protesters, still imprisoned without proper due process or representation, launch a hunger strike to oppose the regimes detention of political prisoners. ""When thousands of Cubans took to the streets in July, the Cuban government responded with a brutal strategy of repression designed to instill fear and suppress dissent,"" said Juan Pappier, senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""Peaceful protesters and other critics have been systematically detained, held incommunicado and abused in horrendous conditions, and subjected to sham trials following patterns that indicate these human rights violations are not the actions of rogue agents."" Those participating in the hunger strike confirmed reports from Human Rights Watch, saying that the Cuban government is torturing detainees and denying them medical care. ""I stand for the release of political prisoners and for my freedom. There are many sick people who are not being cared for,"" 23-year-old Andy Garcia Lorenzo said over the phone from a prison in Santa Clara, according to Diario de Cuba (DDC). ""I want to make a complaint and let the whole world know about it: in Cuba, human rights are not respected. We are many political prisoners who only receive mistreatment and threats and I got tired,"" he said. According to reports from the independent outlet Cubanet, more than 187,000 Cuban citizens nationwide participated in the protests, calling for the end of the regime. The Cuban Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), a non-governmental organization that tracks detentions on the island, documented over 1,000 disappearances or arrests in Cuba between July 11 and August 1. Soon after the protests began, Castro regime underling and figurehead President Miguel Diaz-Canel issued an ""order of combat,"" calling on both government forces and civilian supporters of the regime to retaliate against peaceful protesters with violence. Subsequent videos taken by civilians and posted to social media showed protesters facing live gunshots, receiving gang beatings at the hands of state security officers, and fleeing from tear gas and rubber bullets. The ""systematic"" brutality continued for those arrested during and in the wake of the protests, according to the report, which documented human rights abuses against 130 people in 13 of Cubas 15 provinces, as well as the Isle of Youth. Human Rights Watch reportedly corroborated the abuses by interviewing more than 150 people, including activists, victims, their relatives, journalists, and lawyers with direct knowledge of the cases, in addition to analyzing available case files and documents. ""In most of the cases Human Rights Watch documented, detainees were held incommunicado for days or even weeks, violently arrested, and, in some cases ill-treated during detention,"" according to the report. ""Some were forced to squat naked, apparently deliberately deprived of sleep, brutally beaten, and held in cells without natural light where they say they lost track of time. Others were threatened with reprisals against them or their families for protesting."" Most detainees ""suffered abusive and repeated interrogations,"" sometimes in the middle of the night. They were often asked about the ""organization"" and ""financing"" of demonstrations and were threatened with long prison sentences, according to the report. Gabriela Zequeira Hernandez, a 17-year-old student, said she was arrested in San Miguel de Padron, Havana province, as she was walking past a demonstration on July 11, according to the report. Hernandez said during her detention, two female officers made her strip and squat naked five times while she coughed and pressed on her stomach. ""One of them told her to inspect her own vagina with her finger. Days later, a male officer threatened to take her and two men to the area known as the 'pavilion, where detainees have conjugal visits,"" the report states. ""Officers repeatedly woke her up at night for interrogations, Zequeira said, asking why she had protested and who was ""financing"" her."" She was reportedly sentenced to eight months in prison for ""public disorder"" on July 22 and was only able to see her layers for a few minutes before her hearing. A higher court later ruled that she could serve her sentence in house arrest -- she said she and her family have not been able to obtain copies of the rulings. The report further alleges that many detainees were held in ""dark, crowded, and unsanitary prison cells"" and had little access to clean water or safety measures to prevent the spread of Chinese coronavirus. ""Confirmed positive cases of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] reached some of their highest peaks in Cuba in July and August. Some protesters appeared to have contracted the virus in detention,"" according to the report. Many protesters have been tried in groups of ten or more people, often in closed hearings. Prosecutors reportedly often accuse them of committing ""vaguely defined crimes"" like ""public disorder,"" and based only on statements from police officers, the report states. As of August 19, Cuban authorities, who often obfuscate government data, said only 67 people have been sentenced in connection with the protests. The OCDH estimated in a report published in July that Cuban repressive forces have performed over 30,000 politically motivated arrests in the last five years, many repeat incidents against the islands most vocal dissidents.

Cuba-U.S. tensions mount over pending protests on Communist-run island,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-us-tensions-mount-over-pending-protests-communist-run-island-2021-10-25/,10/25/21,www.reuters.com,"A vintage car passes by the U.S. Embassy carrying a Cuban flag during a motorcade in protest against the trade embargo on Cuba by the U.S. in Havana, Cuba, March 28, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo HAVANA, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel warned the U.S. embassy in Havana against fomenting protests by dissidents on the Communist-run island, the latest flashpoint between the longtime rivals ahead of fresh rallies slated for Nov. 15. Cuba has said the planned demonstrations - scheduled for the same day the Caribbean island will reopen its borders to tourism - are illegal and blames the United States for underwriting them. The United States has threatened Cuba with further sanctions should the government jail protesters. In a speech to Communist party stalwarts late on Sunday, Diaz-Canel doubled down on allegations of U.S. subterfuge, accusing the U.S. embassy of playing a role in fanning protests. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register ""Their embassy in Cuba has been taking an active role in efforts to subvert the internal order of our country,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""U.S. diplomatic officials meet frequently with leaders of the counterrevolution, to whom they provide guidance, encouragement, and logistical and financial support."" The embassy could not immediately be reached for comment. The U.S. diplomatic headquarters in Havana has operated with a skeleton crew since 2017, after employees fell ill with what is now known as 'Havana Syndrome.' Scaled-back operations have hobbled diplomacy between the two Cold War foes and have forced Cubans seeking consular services from the embassy to travel to Guyana instead. Diaz-Canel said the embassy was nonetheless leveraging social media communications to criticize Cuba in ""open interference in the internal affairs of our country."" The embassy in recent weeks has highlighted on social media the cases of several Cubans detained and jailed following the biggest anti-government demonstrations in decades on July 11. The posts on Twitter call in Spanish for the release of dissidents and use the hashtag ""#Presosporque,"" or ""Why are they prisoners?"" Cuban authorities said those arrested in July were guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest, and vandalism. Juan Gonzalez, a top adviser on Latin America to U.S. President Joe Biden, told news agency EFE last week that the United States would respond if protesters were again jailed in November. ""Those individuals who are involved in violating the fundamental and universal rights of the Cuban people... we have made it very clear that we have every intention of responding,"" Gonzalez said. The outcome of the showdown between the Cuban government and increasingly bold dissidents will likely dictate the Biden administration's policy towards the island nation going forward, said William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University in Washington. The Biden administration's ""hostile rhetoric and support for dissidents has led the Cuban government to give up on any hope of better relations with Washington,"" LeoGrande said. ""Ironically, that gives the Cuban government no incentive to treat the upcoming march or its organizers with tolerance.""

Cuba: Communists Display Weapons for 'People's War' on Dissidents,https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2021/10/26/cuba-communists-weapons-war-dissidents/,10/26/21,www.breitbart.com,"Cuban communists flooded social media outlets with images of mobs holding firearms, sticks, rocks, and other makeshift weapons as part of ""acts of revolutionary affirmation"" meant to scare political dissidents out of participating in a march planned for November 15, multiple outlets reported on Monday. The various violent images formed part of the Communist Partys ""Territorial Day of Defense,"" nominally meant to show the world that Cubans are ready to attack anyone working to liberate the island from communism. The Castro dynasty has subjugated the island since dictator Fidel Castro seized power in 1959. The acts occurred on the same weekend as the incumbent figurehead of the Castro dynasty, Miguel Diaz-Canel, called the proposed peaceful march an ""act of subordination to Yankee hegemony"" and threatened that Cubans would ""combat by all means"" any attempt to establish democracy - a threat of violence to civilians considering engaging in pro-democratic action. Diaz-Canel explicitly condemned the November 15 march rather than take the typical approach of hinting vaguely at ""counterrevolutionary"" forces. The march, if successful, would be the first nationwide organized peaceful effort against communism since July 11, when an estimated 187,000 Cubans in every province on the island took the streets demanding an end to the Castro regime. Communist Party security forces responded by arresting hundreds of people - including many bystanders who did not participate in the protests - and conducting violent home raids resulting in severe injuries to suspected protesters, some shot in front of their families. The Spanish-language outlet ADN Cuba noted that several Cuban regime journalists published images on Sunday from various provinces showing communists practicing targeting with firearms and posing menacingly with weapons. Private ownership of firearms is illegal in Cuba. ""THE STREETS BELONG TO THE REVOLUTIONARIES,"" one such regime propagandist, Marta Fernandez, wrote as a caption to her photos on Facebook on Sunday. Fernandez described the display as intended to ""perfect the defense under the concept of an all peoples war."" El Dia Territorial de la Defensa se celebro este domingo en la Prov. de Mtaz en aras de continuar perfeccionando la... Posted by Marta Fernandez on Sunday, October 24, 2021 Another such social media video showed communists in Cardenas, a city in Matanzas province, simulating a response to an ""attack"" by peaceful protesters. Some of those in the video appear menacingly brandishing sticks. Spanish-language journalists identified the people in the photos as members of the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a communist civilian espionage brigade.

De: Beatriz Duquezne. pic.twitter.com/RaKIGUZzF5 -- Rolando Napoles (@RNapoles) October 25, 2021 Other images showed Cubans practicing stoning unspecified enemies in scenes that resemble track and field practices. The participants railed against ""mercenaries"" - a smear the Castro regime uses liberally, and falsely, against pro-democracy dissidents - and vowed to fight them ""to the last drop of blood."" The Cuban independent online publication 14 y Medio noted in its report on the events that Cuban state media omitted coverage of such events from its news broadcasts - regime journalists only posted the images online. Observers concluded from this that the target audience for the content was young people who more regularly get their news from the internet and do not pay much attention to televised government propaganda. For those individuals, Diaz-Canel addressed the nation in a formal speech on Sunday where he renewed a call he made in July for civilians to attack political dissidents. The Castro constitution, he said, ""asserts, among other things, that the socialist system ... is irrevocable, and that citizens have the right to fight by any means against anyone intending to derail the political, social, and economic order established by the Constitution."" Any peaceful expression of dissent with the regime ""is not a civic act - it is an act of subordination to Yankee hegemony,"" Diaz-Canel asserted. ""There are enough revolutionaries here to confront with intelligence, respect, and in defense of our Constitution, but with energy and courage, as well,"" Diaz-Canel concluded, ""any type of manifestation that seeks to destroy the Revolution."" The appointed successor to Raul Castro, whose family retains power in every major Cuban institution, asserted that the November 15 call to march against the regime was ""an escalation in the way to act against the Revolution and a challenge to authorities and the State of socialist rights."" He blamed the United States for allegedly planning the grassroots pro-democracy act, offering no evidence for his claim. Diaz-Canel more concretely urged Cuban to engage in violence against fellow citizens in July following the eruption of protests against the regime that month. ""We are calling all the revolutionaries of our country, all the communists, to go to the streets anywhere that these provocations are happening today, from now on through all these days,"" Diaz-Canel urged. A group of dissidents who identify by the name ""Archipelago"" is calling for a protest on November 15. They took the unprecedented step of applying for a permit for the public assembly through the government this month, a request the regime rapidly rejected. The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported on Monday that hundreds of people arrested in July remain behind bars as of this week. Human rights groups have documented widespread due process violations since this summer, including mass trials for suspected protesters arrested for a variety of unrelated ""crimes"" and the processing of minors in courts for adults. Prosecutors are demanding as much as 25 years in prison for some dissidents. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",
Cuba approves laws granting greater rights as criticism of protesters' arrests heats up,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-approves-laws-granting-greater-rights-criticism-protesters-arrests-heats-up-2021-10-28/,10/28/21,www.reuters.com,"People shout slogans against the government during a protest against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini//File Photo HAVANA, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Cuba's National Assembly on Thursday approved a raft of laws broadening citizens' legal rights even as the Communist-run country comes under fire at home and abroad for a crackdown on protests earlier this year. The changes stem from the 2019 constitution, which required reforms to modernize Cuba's judicial and penal codes. But they address legal voids identified by activists, who allege authorities flaunted due process following unprecedented protests on the island in July. Cuban lawmakers and judges said the new laws increase protection for those accused of a crime and should improve transparency. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register They require, for example, defendants be notified of potential charges against them, and that those detained be granted the right to an attorney within 24 hours. Citizens will also be allowed access to their own court files and documents, according to the new law. Eloy Viera, a Cuban lawyer and legal analyst who lives in Canada, said the laws were a major step forward in enshrining a citizen's right to defend him or herself in a court of law. ""This law offers more guarantees and adheres much more to international standards than the regulations currently in force,"" Viera said. But how those laws are implemented will determine whether or not Cubans see significant changes in their legal rights, said William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University in Washington. ""The laws... still give officials considerable discretion and only time will tell how they use it, especially in political cases,"" he said. Dissidents and human rights organizations say more than 1,000 demonstrators were arrested after the July protests, the largest anti-government rallies since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. Some prisoners were held without charge, incommunicado and without representation, rights groups say. The Cuban government says those arrested in July were guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest and vandalism. It has declared opposition marches planned for Nov. 15 as illegal, saying they are funded and promoted by the United States. The laws passed Thursday are set to take effect in 2022. Legal analyst Viera said it was unlikely they would be retroactive. ""I do not believe that this new legislation will have a definitive influence on the processes already initiated today, and politically motivated, by the July 11 protesters,"" he said. Some legal experts said any advances in the penal code would be overshadowed by the one-party system of government. ""Supreme court justices can still be dismissed easily. No court may declare unconstitutional a National Assembly act,"" said retired Cuban-American scholar Jorge Dominguez. ""There is no independent entity to protect constitutional rights."" The reforms nonetheless eliminate a long-critiqued law that allowed authorities to jail someone they said was potentially dangerous, a maneuver critics say was often used against dissidents. They also include a prohibition on unlawful detention. Independent journalist Yoani Sanchez said that was not enough. ""Repressive laws are still in force that are arbitrarily applied frequently against opponents, activists and independent journalists, such as home confinement and the prohibition of leaving the country,"" she wrote.
